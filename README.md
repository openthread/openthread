OpenThread is an open-source implementation of the [Thread][thread]
networking protocol. Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology
used in Nest products more broadly available to developers to accelerate 
the development of products for the connected home.

The Thread specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and
low-power wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home
applications. More information about Thread can be found on
[threadgroup.org](http://threadgroup.org/).
