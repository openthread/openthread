# What is OpenThread?  

OpenThread is...

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/openthread/openthread/ab4c4e1e/doc/images/certified.svg" alt="Thread Certified Component" width="150px" align="right">
</a>

**...an open-source implementation of the [Thread](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology) networking protocol.** Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology used in Nest products more broadly available to developers to accelerate the development of products for the connected home.

**...OS and platform agnostic**, with a narrow platform abstraction layer and a small memory footprint, making it highly portable.

**...a Thread Certified Component**, implementing all features defined in the [Thread 1.1.1 specification](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology#specifications). This specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and low-power wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home applications.

More information about Thread can be found on [threadgroup.org](http://threadgroup.org/).

# Get started with OpenThread

<a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/openthread-simulation/index.html">
<img src="doc/images/ot-codelab.png" alt="OpenThread Codelab" width="300px" align="right">
</a>

Want to try OpenThread? The quickest way to get started is to run through our [Simulation Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/openthread-simulation/index.html), which covers all the basics, without the need for test hardware. Using VirtualBox and Vagrant on a Mac or Linux machine, you will learn:

* How to set up the OpenThread build toolchain
* How to simulate a Thread network
* How to authenticate Thread nodes with Commissioning
* How to use `wpantund` to manage a simulated Thread network featuring an NCP

### Next Steps

The Codelab shows you how easy it is use to OpenThread to simulate a Thread network. Once complete:

1. Learn more about the [OpenThread architecture and features](#openthread-features)
1. Get familiar with [platforms and devices that support OpenThread](#who-supports-openthread)
1. See what [testing tools](#what-tools-are-available-for-testing) are available
1. Learn [where to get help](#need-help) and [how to contribute](#want-to-contribute) to the ongoing development of OpenThread

# OpenThread Features

OpenThread implements all features defined in the [Thread 1.1.1 specification](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology#specifications), including all Thread networking layers (IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, Mesh Routing) and device roles.

OpenThread supports both system-on-chip (SoC) and network co-processor (NCP) designs. Other features and enhancements include:

* Application support and services
    * IPv6 configuration and raw data interface
    * UDP sockets
    * CoAP client and server
    * DHCPv6 client and server
    * DNSv6 client
    * Command Line Interface (CLI)
* NCP support
    * Spinel - general purpose NCP protocol
    * `wpantund` - user-space NCP network interface driver/daemon
    * Sniffer support via NCP Spinel nodes

### What's coming?

The development of OpenThread is ongoing to regularly provide additional features not available in the standard. Currently, we are working on:

* Host-side Border Agent support

# Who supports OpenThread?

Led by Nest, the following companies are contributing to the ongoing development of OpenThread:

OpenThread has been ported to several devices and platforms. Build examples are included in the OpenThread project.

### IEEE 802.15.4 Platform Support

* [Dialog Semiconductor DA15000](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms#dialog-da15000)
* [Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms#nordic-semiconductor-nrf52840)
* [Texas Instruments CC2538](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms#texas-instruments-cc2538)
* [Texas Instruments CC2650](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms#texas-instruments-cc2650)
* [POSIX Emulation](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms#posix-emulation)

See the [Wiki Platform page](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/Platforms) for more detailed information on supported platforms.

### Desktop Support

Desktop platforms can also be used to control and interface with a Thread network using OpenThread:

* **Unix** — [`wpantund`](https://github.com/openthread/wpantund) provides an interface to an NCP
* **Windows 10** — [universal drivers](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/wiki/OpenThread-on%C2%A0Windows) to interface with devices running OpenThread

# What tools are available for testing?

### Certification Testing

Certification testing is done with the [GRL Thread Test Harness software](http://graniteriverlabs.com/thread/), available for download to Thread member companies.

Additional tools that extend the Test Harness are included in the OpenThread project:

* [Thread Harness Automation](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/tools/harness-automation) — automates the Thread Test Harness software
* [Thread Harness THCI for OpenThread](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/tools/harness-thci) — allows the Thread Test Harness to control OpenThread-based reference devices directly
    * CC2538 example included in the GRL Thread Test Hardness software
    * Library version can be modified by developers for use on other platforms

### Sniffer

OpenThread also provides a [sniffer](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/blob/master/tools/spinel-cli/SNIFFER.md) on the NCP build. The sniffer is exposed by the Spinel protocol and features:

* Monitor mode — capture packets during operation
* Promiscuous mode — dedicated sniffer
* Host-side support — `wpantund`
* pcap stream output
