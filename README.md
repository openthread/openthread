[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openthread/openthread.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openthread/openthread)

OpenThread is an open-source implementation of the [Thread](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology) networking protocol. With OpenThread, Nest is making the technology used in Nest products more broadly available to accelerate the development of products for the connected home.

The Thread specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and low-power wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home applications. More information about Thread can be found on [threadgroup.org](http://www.threadgroup.org/).

## Features
- Highly portable: OS and platform agnostic, with a radio abstraction layer
- Implements the End Device, Router, Leader & Border Router roles
- Small memory footprint

OpenThread implements all Thread networking layers, including IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, and Mesh Routing.
