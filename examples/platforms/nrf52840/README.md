## Prerequisites

Before you start building the examples, you must download and install the toolchain and the tools required for flashing and debugging.

### Toolchain

Download and install the [GNU toolchain for ARM Cortex-M][gnu-toolchain].

[gnu-toolchain]: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

To install the GNU toolchain and its dependencies, run the following commands in Bash:

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

### Flashing and debugging tools

[nRF5-Command-Line-Tools]: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF5-Command-Line-Tools

Install the [nRF5 Command Line Tools][nRF5-Command-Line-Tools] to flash, debug, and make use of logging features on the nRF52840 DK with SEGGER J-Link.

## Building the examples

 To build the examples, run the following command in Bash:

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>
$ ./bootstrap
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840
```

After a successful build, the `elf` files can be found in
`<path-to-openthread>/output/nrf52840/bin`.
You can convert them to hex using `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`:
```bash
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex ot-cli-ftd ot-cli-ftd.hex
```

You can build the libraries with support for the native USB CDC ACM as a serial transport.
To do so, build the firmware with the following parameter:
```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 USB=1
```

If you are using Windows 7 or earlier, you must load an additional USB CDC driver.
The driver can be found in `third_party/NordicSemiconductor/libraries/usb/nordic_cdc_acm_example.inf`.

### nRF52840 dongle support (PCA10059)

You can build the libraries with support for the USB bootloader with USB DFU trigger support in PCA10059. As this dongle uses the native USB support, you must enable it as well.

To build the libraries, run make with the following parameters:

```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 USB=1 BOOTLOADER=1
```

See [nRF52840 Dongle Programming][nrf52840-dongle-programming] for more details about how to use the USB bootloader.

[nrf52840-dongle-programming]: https://www.nordicsemi.com/DocLib/Content/User_Guides/nrf52840_dongle/latest/UG/nrf52840_Dongle/programming

### Native SPI support

You can build the libraries with support for native SPI Slave.
To build the libraries, run make with the following parameter:

```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 NCP_SPI=1
```

With this option enabled, SPI communication between the NCP example and wpantund is possible
(provided that the wpantund host supports SPI Master). To achieve that, an appropriate SPI device
should be chosen in wpantund configuration file, `/etc/wpantund.conf`. You can find an example below.
```
Config:NCP:SocketPath "system:/usr/bin/spi-hdlc-adapter --gpio-int /sys/class/gpio/gpio25 /dev/spidev0.0"
```

In this example, [spi-hdlc-adapter][spi-hdlc-adapter] is a tool that you can use to communicate between NCP and wpantund over SPI. For this example, `spi-hdlc-adapter` is installed in `/usr/bin`.

The default SPI Slave pin configuration for nRF52840 is defined in `examples/platforms/nrf52840/platform-config.h`.

Note that the native SPI Slave support is not intended to be used with Engineering sample A of the nRF52840 chip due to
single transfer size limitation.

### Optional prefix for compiler command

You can prefix the compiler command using the CCPREFIX parameter. This speeds up the compilation when you use tools like [ccache][ccache-website]. Example usage:

[ccache-website]: https://ccache.samba.org/

```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 USB=1 CCPREFIX=ccache
```

### Optional disabling of CryptoCell 310 support

By default, mbedTLS library is built with support for CryptoCell 310 hardware acceleration of cryptographic operations used in OpenThread. You can disable CryptoCell 310 and use software cryptography instead by building OpenThread with the following parameter:
```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 DISABLE_CC310=1
```

## Flashing the binaries

Flash the compiled binaries onto nRF52840 using `nrfjprog` which is
part of the [nRF5 Command Line Tools][nRF5-Command-Line-Tools].

```bash
$ nrfjprog -f nrf52 --chiperase --program output/nrf52840/bin/ot-cli-ftd.hex --reset
```

## Running the example

To test the example:

1. Prepare two boards with the flashed `CLI Example` (as shown above). The CLI FTD example uses the direct UART connection.

2. Open a terminal connection on two boards:

   a. Start a terminal emulator like screen.

   b. Connect to the used COM port with the following direct UART settings:

   * Baud rate: 115200
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No parity
   * HW flow control: RTS/CTS
     This allows you to view the raw UART output.

     On Linux system a port name should be called e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyACM1`.

   c. Run the following command to connect to a board.

   ```shell
   screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
   ```

   Now you are connected with the CLI.

3. Use the following commands to form a network on the first board.

   ```bash
   > panid 0xabcd
   Done
   > ifconfig up
   Done
   > thread start
   Done
   ```

   After a couple of seconds the node will become a Leader of the network.

   ```bash
   > state
   Leader
   ```

4. Use the following commands to attach to the network on the second board.

   ```bash
   > panid 0xabcd
   Done
   > ifconfig up
   Done
   > thread start
   Done
   ```

   After a couple of seconds the second node will attach and become a Child.

   ```bash
   > state
   Child
   ```

5. List all IPv6 addresses of the first board.

   ```bash
   > ipaddr
   fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
   fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:9c00
   fdde:ad00:beef:0:4bcb:73a5:7c28:318e
   fe80:0:0:0:5c91:c61:b67c:271c
   ```

6. Choose one of them and send an ICMPv6 ping from the second board.

   ```bash
   > ping fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
   16 bytes from fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=8ms
   ```

## SEGGER J-Link tools

SEGGER J-Link tools allow to debug and flash generated firmware using on-board debugger or external one.

### Working with RTT logging

By default, the OpenThread's logging module provides functions to output logging
information over SEGGER's Real Time Transfer (RTT).

You can set the desired log level by using the `OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL` define.

To enable the highest verbosity level, append `FULL_LOGS` flag to the `make` command:
```
$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 FULL_LOGS=1
```

#### Enable logging on Windows

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `J-Link RTT Viewer`. The configuration window appears.
3. From the Specify Target Device dropdown menu, select `NRF52840_XXAA`.
4. From the Target Interface & Speed dropdown menu, select `SWD`.

#### Enable logging on Linux

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `JLinkExe` to connect to the target. For example:
```
JLinkExe -device NRF52840_XXAA -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1 -SelectEmuBySN <SEGGER_ID> -RTTTelnetPort 19021
```
3. Run `JLinkRTTTelnet` to obtain the RTT logs from the connected device in a separate console. For example:
```
JLinkRTTClient -RTTTelnetPort 19021
```

### Mass Storage Device known issue

Depending on your version, due to a known issue in SEGGER's J-Link firmware, you might experience data corruption or data drops if you use the serial port. You can avoid this issue by disabling the Mass Storage Device.

#### Disabling the Mass Storage Device on Windows

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `J-Link Commander`. The configuration window appears.
3. From the Specify Target Device dropdown menu, select `NRF52840_XXAA`.
4. From the Target Interface & Speed dropdown menu, select `SWD`.
5. Run the following command:
```
MSDDisable
```
6. Power cycle the DK.

#### Disabling the Mass Storage Device on Linux

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `JLinkExe` to connect to the target. For example:
```
JLinkExe -device NRF52840_XXAA -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1 -SelectEmuBySN <SEGGER_ID>
```
3. Run the following command:
```
MSDDisable
```
4. Power cycle the DK.

### Hardware Flow Control detection

By default, SEGGER J-Link automatically detects at runtime whether the target is using Hardware Flow Control (HWFC).

The automatic HWFC detection is done by driving P0.07 (Clear to Send - CTS) from the interface MCU and evaluating the state of P0.05 (Request to Send - RTS) when the first data is sent or received. If the state of P0.05 (RTS) is high, it is assumed that HWFC is not used.

To avoid potential race conditions, you can force HWFC and bypass the runtime auto-detection.

#### Disabling the HWFC detection on Windows

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `J-Link Commander`. The configuration window appears.
3. From the Specify Target Device dropdown menu, select `NRF52840_XXAA`.
4. From the Target Interface & Speed dropdown menu, select `SWD`.
5. Run the following command:
```
SetHWFC Force
```
6. Power cycle the DK.

#### Disabling the HWFC detection on Linux

1. Connect the DK to your machine with a USB cable.
2. Run `JLinkExe` to connect to the target. For example:
```
JLinkExe -device NRF52840_XXAA -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1 -SelectEmuBySN <SEGGER_ID>
```
3. Run the following command:
```
SetHWFC Force
```
4. Power cycle the DK.
