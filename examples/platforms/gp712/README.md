# OpenThread on Qorvo gp712 Example

This directory contains example platform drivers for Qorvo gp712 on RPi.

## Toolchain

This example uses the GNU GCC toolchain on the Raspberry Pi. To build on the Pi:

1. Download the repo to the Pi
2. go to the subfolder in the openthread repo: third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo/ and enter this command:

```bash
$ make tools
```

Note that you may need to install additional packages to make this build work, depending on your actual RPi OS version. The build process will complain if additional packages are required.

## Build Examples

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>
$ ./script/bootstrap
$ ./bootstrap
$ REFERENCE_DEVICE=1 CLI_LOGGING=1 COMMISSIONER=1 JOINER=1 DHCP6_CLIENT=1 DHCP6_SERVER=1 BORDER_ROUTER=1 make -f examples/Makefile-gp712
```

After a successful build, the `elf` files are found in `<path-to-openthread>/output/gp712/bin`.

## Cmake build

Make sure arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc compiler installed in `$PATH`

```bash
cd <path-to-openthread>
./script/cmake-build gp712
```

After a successful build, binary files will be generated:

```
./build/gp712/examples/apps/ncp/ot-rcp
./build/gp712/examples/apps/cli/ot-cli-ftd
```

##

## Interact

1. Spawn the process:

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>/output/gp712/bin
$ ./gp712-ot-cli-ftd
```
