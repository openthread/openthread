# OpenThread on CC1352 Example

This directory contains example platform drivers for the [Texas Instruments CC1352R1][cc1352r1].

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. As a result, the example platform drivers do not necessarily highlight the platform's full capabilities. Consult the [SimpleLink CC26X2R1 SDK][cc26x2r1-sdk] for more development option. The platform drivers were built for the [CC1352R1 LAUNCHXL][cc1352r1-launchxl], usage on other boards with a cc1352r1 may require changes to the peripheral drivers.

## Toolchain

Building the examples for the cc1352 requires [GNU AutoConf][gnu-autoconf], [GNU AutoMake][gnu-automake], [Python][python], and the [ARM gcc toolchain][arm-toolchain].

With the exception of the arm toolchain, most of these tools are installed by default on modern Posix systems. It is recommended to setup a Linux virtual machine for building on a Windows host system. For help setting up VirtualBox with Ubuntu, consult this [community help wiki article][ubuntu-wiki-virtualbox].

[gnu-autoconf]: https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf
[gnu-automake]: https://www.gnu.org/software/automake
[python]: https://www.python.org
[arm-toolchain]: https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm
[cygwin]: https://www.cygwin.com
[mingw]: http://www.mingw.org
[ubuntu-wiki-virtualbox]: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox

In a Bash terminal, follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

## Building

In a Bash terminal, follow these instructions to build the cc1352 examples.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-openthread>
$ ./bootstrap
$ make -f examples/Makefile-cc1352
```

## Flash Binaries

If the build completed successfully, the `elf` files may be found in `<path-to-openthread>/output/cc1352/bin`.

Flash the images with [Uniflash][uniflash]. Make sure to deselect the binary check-box, Uniflash assumes a file without an extension is a binary file.

## Interact

### CLI example

1. With a terminal client (PuTTY, minicom, etc.) open the com port associated with the cc1352 UART. The serial port settings are:
   - 115200 baud
   - 8 data bits
   - no parity bit
   - 1 stop bit
2. Type `help` for a list of commands.
3. Follow the instructions in the [CLI README][cli-readme] for instructions on setting up a network.
