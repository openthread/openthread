SPI/HDLC Adaptor
================

`spi-hdlc-adapter` is an adapter tool for using a SPI interface as if
it were an HDLC-lite encoded bidirectional asynchronous serial stream.
It uses the SPI protocol outlined in [Appendix A.2][1] of the Spinel
protocol document.

## Syntax ##

    spi-hdlc-adapter [options] <spi-device-path>

## Options ##

*   `--stdio`: Use `stdin` and `stdout` for HDLC input/output. Useful
    when directly started by the program that will be using it.
*   `--pty`: Create a pseudo terminal for HDLC input/output. The path
    of the newly-created PTY will be written to `stdout`, followed by
    a newline.
*   `--raw`: Do not encode/decode packets using HDLC. Instead, write
    whole, raw frames to the specified input and output FDs. This is
    useful for emulating a serial port, or when datagram-based sockets
    are supplied for `stdin` and `stdout` (when used with `--stdio`).
*   `--mtu=[MTU]`: Specify the MTU. Currently only used in raw mode.
    Default and maximum value is 2043. Must be greater than zero.
*   `--gpio-int[=gpio-path]`: Specify a path to the Linux
    sysfs-exported GPIO directory for the `I̅N̅T̅` pin. If not
    specified, `spi-hdlc-adapter` will fall back to polling, which is
    inefficient.
*   `--gpio-reset[=gpio-path]`: Specify a path to the Linux
    sysfs-exported GPIO directory for the `R̅E̅S̅` pin.
*   `--spi-mode[=mode]`: Specify the SPI mode to use (0-3). Default
    value is `0`.
*   `--spi-speed[=hertz]`: Specify the SPI speed in hertz. Default
    value is `1000000` (1MHz).
*   `--spi-cs-delay[=usec]`: Specify the delay after C̅S̅ assertion,
    in microseconds. Default is 20µs. Note that this may need to be
    set to zero for spi-hdlc-adapter to work with some SPI drivers.
*   `--spi-align-allowance[=n]`: Specify the maximum number of 0xFF
    bytes to clip from start of MISO frame. This makes this tool usable
    with SPI slaves which have buggy SPI blocks that prepend a variable
    number of 0xFF bytes to the start of MISO frame. Default value is `0`.
    Maximum value is `16`. *This should be set to `7` for chips in the
    SiLabs EM35x family.*
*   `--spi-small-packet=[n]`: Specify the smallest packet we can receive
    in a single SPI transaction. Packets sent by the slave which are smaller
    than or equal to this size will require only a single SPI transaction
    to be successfully transmitted. Increasing this value will (up to a point)
    decrease latency for smaller packets at the expense of overall bandwidth.
    Default value is 32. The minimum value is 0. The maximum value is 2043.
*   `--verbose`: Increase debug verbosity.
*   `--help`: Print out usage information to `stdout` and exit.

`spi-device-path` is a required argument since it indicates which SPI
device to use. An example path might be `/dev/spidev1.0`.

The GPIO paths are to the top-level directory for that GPIO. They must
be already be exported before `spi-hdlc-adapter` can use them.

## Behavior ##

If an MCU reset is detected by the reset bit being set on a SPI frame,
the special vendor-specific HDLC-lite symbol `0xF8` is emitted. If
`--gpio-reset` is specified, the HDLC client can trigger an MCU reset
by sending the symbols `0x7E 0x13 0x11 0x7E` or by sending `SIGUSR1`.

When started, `spi-hdlc-adapter` will configure the following
properties on the GPIOs:

1.  Set `I̅N̅T̅/direction` to `in`.
2.  Set `I̅N̅T̅/edge` to `falling`.
3.  Set `R̅E̅S̅/direction` to `high`.

When resetting the slave device, `spi-hdlc` performs the following
procedure:

1.  Set `R̅E̅S̅/direction` to `low`.
2.  Sleep for 30ms.
3.  Set `R̅E̅S̅/direction` to `high`.

## Statistics ##

Some simple usage statistics are printed out to syslog at exit and
whenever the `SIGUSR1` signal is received. The easiest way to send
that signal to `spi-hdlc-adapter` is like this:

    # killall -sigusr1 spi-hdlc-adapter

At which point you will see something like this in the syslogs:

    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSlaveResetCount=16
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSpiFrameCount=2673
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSpiValidFrameCount=2668
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSpiDuplexFrameCount=3
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSpiUnresponsiveFrameCount=5
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sSpiGarbageFrameCount=0
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sHdlcTxFrameCount=1454
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sHdlcTxFrameByteCount=2908
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sHdlcRxFrameCount=884
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sHdlcRxFrameByteCount=3875
    spi-hdlc-adapter[18408]: INFO: sHdlcRxBadCrcCount=0

Sending `SIGUSR2` will clear the counters.
