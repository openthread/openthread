# Spinel CLI Reference

The Spinel CLI exposes the OpenThread configuration and management APIs
running on an NCP build via a command line interface.  Spinel CLI is primarily
targeted for driving the automated continuous integration tests, and is
suitable for manual experimentation with controlling OpenThread NCP instances.
For a production grade host driver, see [wpantund]: https://github.com/openthread/wpantund.

Use the CLI to play with NCP builds of OpenThread on a Linux or Mac OS
platform, including starting a basic tunnel interface to allow IPv6
applications to run on the HOST and use the Thread network.

The power of this tool is three fold:

1. As a path to add testing of the NCP in simulation to continuous integration
2. As a path to automated testing of testbeds running NCP firmware on hardware
3. As a simple debugging tool for NCP builds of OpenThread

## System Requirements

| OS     | Minimum Version  |
|--------|------------------|
| Ubuntu | 14.04 Trusty     |
| Mac OS | 10.11 El Capitan |

| Language | Minimum Version  |
|----------|------------------|
| Python   | 2.7.10           |

### Package Installation

```
# From openthread root
cd tools/spinel-cli
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### NAME
    spinel-cli.py - shell tool for controlling OpenThread NCP instances

### SYNOPSIS
    spinel-cli.py [-hupsnqv]

### DESCRIPTION

```
    -h, --help            
    	Show this help message and exit

    -u <UART>, --uart=<UART>
       	Open a serial connection to the OpenThread NCP device
	where <UART> is a device path such as "/dev/ttyUSB0".

    -p <PIPE>, --pipe=<PIPE>
        Open a piped process connection to the OpenThread NCP device
        where <PIPE> is the command to start an emulator, such as
        "ot-ncp-ftd".  Spinel-cli will communicate with the child process
        via stdin/stdout.

    -s <SOCKET>, --socket=<SOCKET>
        Open a socket connection to the OpenThread NCP device
        where <SOCKET> is the port to open.
	This is useful for SPI configurations when used in conjunction
	with a spinel spi-driver daemon.
	Note: <SOCKET> will eventually map to hostname:port tuple.

    -n NODEID, --nodeid=NODEID
        The unique nodeid for the HOST and NCP instance.

    -q, --quiet
        Minimize debug and log output.

    -v, --verbose
        Maximize debug and log output.
```

## Quick Start

The spinel-cli tool provides an intuitive command line interface, including
all the standard OpenThread CLI commands, plus full history accessible by
pressing the up/down keys, or searchable via ^R.  There are a few commands
that spinel-cli provides as well that aren't part of the standard set
documented in the command reference section.

```
openthread$ cd tools/spinel-cli/
spinel-cli$ ./spinel-cli.py

## Running the NCP Tests

The OpenThread automated test suite can be run against any of the following
node types by passing the NODE_TYPE environment variable:

| NODE_TYPE     |    Description                                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| sim (default) | Runs against ot-cli posix emulator                 |
| ncp-sim       | Runs against ot-ncp posix emulator with spinel-cli |
| soc           | Runs against CLI firmware on a device connected via /dev/ttyUSB<nodeid>  |

### Manual run of NCP thread-cert test

```
# From top-level of openthread tree
./bootstrap
./configure --with-examples=posix --enable-cli-app=all --enable-ncp-app=all --with-ncp-bus=uart
make
cd tests/scripts/thread-cert
NODE_TYPE=ncp-sim top_builddir=../../.. python Cert_5_1_02_ChildAddressTimeout.py VERBOSE=1
```

### Run entire NCP thread-cert suite

```
# From top-level of openthread tree
make distclean
./bootstrap
NODE_TYPE=ncp-sim BUILD_TARGET=posix-distcheck DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--with-examples=posix --enable-cli-app --enable-ncp-app=all --with-ncp-bus=uart --with-tests=all" make -f examples/Makefile-posix distcheck BuildJobs=10 VERBOSE=1
```

## Command Reference

### OpenThread CLI Commands

The primary intent of spinel-cli is to support the exact syntax and output
of the OpenThread CLI command set in order to seamlessly reapply the
thread-cert automated test suite against NCP targets.

See [cli module][1] for more information on these commands.

[1]:../../src/cli/README.md

### Diagnostics CLI Commands

The Diagnostics module is enabled only when building OpenThread with
the --enable-diag configure option.

See [diag module][2] for more information on these commands.

[2]:../../src/diag/README.md


### NCP CLI Commands

These commands extend beyond the core OpenThread CLI, and are specific to
the spinel-cli tool for the purposes of debugging, access to NCP-specific
Spinel parameters, and support of advanced configurations.
