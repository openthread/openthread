 * The sub-MAC layer handles the following (if not provided by radio platform):
 *
 *    - Ack timeout for frame transmission,
 *    - CSMA backoff logic,
 *    - Frame re-transmissions,
 *    - Energy scan on a single channel and RSSI sampling.
 *
 * It also act as the interface (to radio platform) for setting/getting radio configurations such as short or extended
 * addresses and PAN Id.
