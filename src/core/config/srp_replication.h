 * removed and wait for `REMOVE_TIMEOUT` interval before removing it from the list of partners and dropping any
 * connection/session to it. This ensures that if the partner is re-added within the `REMOVE_TIMEOUT`. we continue
 * with any existing connection/session and potentially avoid going through session establishment and initial sync

 * Specifies the minimum reconnect interval in milliseconds.

 * If there is a disconnect or failure (misbehavior) on an SRPL session with a partner, the reconnect interval
 * is used before trying to connect again or accepting connection request from the partner.
 *
 * The reconnect interval starts as `MIN_RECONNECT_INTERVAL`. On back-to-back failures the reconnect interval
 * is increased using growth factor (given by `GROWTH_FACTOR_NUMERATOR` and `GROWTH_FACTOR_DENOMINATOR`) up to
 * maximum value `MAX_RECONNECT_INTERVAL`. The reconnect interval is reset back to its minimum value after
 * successfully establishing an SRPL session with the partner and successfully finishing the initial synchronization.
