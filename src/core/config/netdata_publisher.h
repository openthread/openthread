/**
 * @def OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_NETDATA_PUBLISHER_EXTRA_DELAY_TIME_TO_REMOVE_PREFERRED
 *
 * Specifies the extra wait time (in milliseconds) used when removing a preferred entry.
 *
 * When removing entries, certain entries are preferred over others. How the preference is determined depends on the
 * entry type (e.g., (for DNS/SRP service entries associated with smaller RLOC16 or smaller IPv6 address are preferred).
 * If the `Publisher` determines that its own entry is a preferred one, it adds the above extra wait time in addition
 * to the random wait selected based on `OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_NETDATA_PUBLISHER_MAX_DELAY_TO_REMOVE` before removing
 * its entry. This gives higher chance for a non-preferred entry from another device to be removed before removing a
 * preferred entry which helps towards quicker convergence of the process to the desired number of entries.
 *
 * It is recommended that `OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_NETDATA_PUBLISHER_EXTRA_DELAY_TIME_TO_REMOVE_PREFERRED` to be set to a
 * value larger than `OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_NETDATA_PUBLISHER_MAX_DELAY_TO_REMOVE` to ensure that non-preferred entries
 * are removed first.
