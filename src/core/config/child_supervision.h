 * @def OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_CHILD_SUPERVISION_INTERVAL
 *
 * The default supervision interval in seconds to use when in child state. Zero indicates no supervision needed.
 *
 * The current supervision interval can be changed using `otChildSupervisionSetInterval()`.
 *
 * Child supervision feature provides a mechanism for parent to ensure that a message is sent to each sleepy child
 * within the supervision interval. If there is no transmission to the child within the supervision interval, child
 * supervisor will enqueue and send a supervision message (a data message with empty payload) to the child.

/**
 * @def OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_CHILD_SUPERVISION_CHECK_TIMEOUT

 *
 * The check timeout interval can be changed using `otChildSupervisionSetCheckTimeout()`.
 *
 * If the sleepy child does not hear from its parent within the specified timeout interval, it initiates the re-attach
 * process (MLE Child Update Request/Response exchange with its parent).

/**
 * @def OPENTHREAD_CONFIG_CHILD_SUPERVISION_OLDER_VERSION_CHILD_DEFAULT_INTERVAL
 *
 * Specifies the default supervision interval to use on parent for children that do not explicitly indicate their
 * desired supervision internal (do not include a "Supervision Interval TLV") and are running older Thread versions
 * (version <= 1.3.0).
 *
 * This config is added to allow backward compatibility on parent with SED children that used Child Supervision
 * feature in OT stack before adoption of it by Thread specification and addition of the "Supervision Interval TLV" as
 * the mechanism for child to inform the parent of its desired supervision interval.
 *
 * The config can be set to zero to effectively disable it, i.e., if a child does not provide "Supervision Interval TLV"
 * it indicates that it does not want to be supervised and then parent will use zero interval for the child.
