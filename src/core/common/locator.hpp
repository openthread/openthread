 * This class implements a locator for an OpenThread Instance object.
 *
 * The `InstanceLocator` is used as base class of almost all other OpenThread classes. It provides a way for an object
 * to get to its owning/parent OpenThread `Instance` and other objects within the OpenTread hierarchy (e.g. the
 * `ThreadNetif` or `Ip6::Ip6` objects).
 *
 * If multiple-instance feature is supported, the owning/parent OpenThread `Instance` is tracked as a reference. In the
 * single-instance case, this class becomes an empty base class.
