/**
 *
 * Child supervision feature provides a mechanism for parent
 * to ensure that a message is sent to each sleepy child within
 * a fixed interval, namely the supervision interval. If there
 * is no transmission to the child within the supervision
 * interval, child supervisor enqueues and sends a supervision
 * message (a data message with empty payload) to the child.
 *
 * On the child side, this is used to check the connectivity
 * to the parent. If the child does not hear from its parent
 * for a pre-specified timeout interval it assumes that it may
 * be disconnected and tries to re-attach to the parent.
 *
 * The child supervision provides an alternative, more
 * energy-efficient solution compared to requiring the sleepy child
 * to periodically perform an MLE Child Update Request/Response
 * exchange with the parent (as a way of verifying that it
 * is still connected to the parent). The child supervision
 * solution puts the burden of message transmissions on the
 * parent instead of the typically more energy-constrained child.
 *
 * Note that most radios generate an auto-ack in hardware in
 * response to a received frame, so the child cannot solely rely
 * on the 15.4 acknowledgments it receives from parent as an
 * indicator that it is still connected and is in parent's
 * child table.
