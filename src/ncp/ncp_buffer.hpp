     * NcpFrameBuffer Implementation
     * -----------------------------
     *
     * NcpFrameBuffer internally stores a frame as a sequence of data segments. The data segments are stored in the
     * the main buffer `mBuffer`. mBuffer is utilized as a circular buffer.

     * Messages (which are added using `InFrameFeedMessaged()`) are not copied in the `mBuffer` but instead are
     * enqueued in a message queue `mMessageQueue`.
     *
     * The data segments include a header before the data portion. The header is 2 bytes long is formated as follows
     *
     *    Bit 0-13: Give the length of the data segment (max segment len is 2^14 = 16,384 bytes).
     *    Bit 14:   Flag bit set to indicate that this segment has an associated `Message` (appended to its end).
     *    Bit 15:   Flag bit set to indicate that this segment defines the start of a new frame.
     *
     *        Bit  15         Bit 14            Bits: 0 - 13
     *    +--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
     *    |   New Frame  |  Has Message |  Length of segment (excluding the header)              |
     *    +--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
     *
     * The header is encoded in big-endian (msb first) style.

     * Consider the following calls to create a frame:
     *
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameBegin();
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameFeedData("Hello", 5);
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameFeedData("There", 5);
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameFeedMessage(*someMessage);
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameFeedData("Bye", 3);
     *    ncpBuffer.InFrameEnd();
     *
     * This frame is stored as two segments:
     *
     *    - Segment #1 contains "HelloThere" with a header of `0xC00A` which shows that this segment contains 10 data
     *      bytes, and it starts a new frame, and also must include a message from the message queue.
     *
     *    - Segment #2 contains "Bye" with a header value of `0x0003` showing length of 3 and no appended message.
     *
     *    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     *    | C0  | 0A  | `H` | 'e' | 'l' | 'l' | 'o' | 'T' | 'h' | 'e' | 'r' | 'e' | 00  | 03  | 'B' | 'y' | 'e' |
     *    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     *     \         /                                                             \         /
