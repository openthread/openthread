/*
 *   SPI Framing Protocol
 *
 *   Each SPI frame starts with a 5-byte frame header:
 *
 *                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+
 *                  | Octets: |  1  |    2     |    2     |
 *                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+
 *                  | Fields: | HDR | RECV_LEN | DATA_LEN |
 *                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+
 *
 *   -  "HDR": The first byte is the header byte (defined below)
 *   -  "RECV_LEN": The second and third bytes indicate the largest frame
 *      size that that device is ready to receive.  If zero, then the
 *      other device must not send any data. (Little endian)
 *   -  "DATA_LEN": The fourth and fifth bytes indicate the size of the
 *      pending data frame to be sent to the other device.  If this value
 *      is equal-to or less-than the number of bytes that the other device
 *      is willing to receive, then the data of the frame is immediately
 *      after the header. (Little Endian)
 *
 *   The "HDR" byte is defined as:
 *
 *                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *                     |RST|CRC|CCF|  RESERVED |PATTERN|
 *                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 *   -  "RST": This bit is set when that device has been reset since the
 *      last time `CS` (chip select) was asserted.
 *   -  "CRC": This bit is set when that device supports writing a 16-bit
 *      CRC at the end of the data.  The CRC length is NOT included in
 *      DATA_LEN.
 *   -  "CCF": "CRC Check Failure".  Set if the CRC check on the last
 *      received frame failed, cleared to zero otherwise.  This bit is
 *      only used if both sides support CRC.
 *   -  "RESERVED": These bits are all reserved for future used.  They
 *      MUST be cleared to zero and MUST be ignored if set.
 *   -  "PATTERN": These bits are set to a fixed value to help distinguish
 *      valid SPI frames from garbage (by explicitly making "0xFF" and
 *      "0x00" invalid values).  Bit 6 MUST be set to be one and bit 7
 *      MUST be cleared (0).  A frame received that has any other values
 *      for these bits MUST be dropped.
 *
 *   Prior to a sending or receiving a frame, the master MAY send a
 *   5-octet frame with zeros for both the max receive frame size and the
 *   the contained frame length.  This will induce the slave device to
 *   indicate the length of the frame it wants to send (if any) and
 *   indicate the largest frame it is capable of receiving at the moment.
 *   This allows the master to calculate the size of the next transaction.
 *   Alternatively, if the master has a frame to send it can just go ahead
 *   and send a frame of that length and determine if the frame was
 *   accepted by checking that the "RECV_LEN" from the slave frame is
 *   larger than the frame the master just tried to send.  If the
 *   "RECV_LEN" is smaller then the frame wasn't accepted and will need to
 *   be transmitted again.
 *
 *   This protocol can be used either unidirectionally or bidirectionally,
 *   determined by the behavior of the master and the slave.
 *
 *   If the the master notices "PATTERN" is not set correctly, the master
 *   should consider the transaction to have failed and try again after 10
 *   milliseconds, retrying up to 200 times.  After unsuccessfully trying
 *   200 times in a row, the master MAY take appropriate remedial action
 *   (like a NCP hardware reset, or indicating a communication failure to
 *   a user interface).
 *
 *   At the end of the data of a frame is an optional 16-bit CRC, support
 *   for which is indicated by the "CRC" bit of the "HDR" byte being set.
 *   If these bits are set for both the master and slave frames, then CRC
 *   checking is enabled on both sides, effectively requiring that frame
 *   sizes be two bytes longer than would be otherwise required.  The CRC
 *   is calculated using the same mechanism used for the CRC calculation
 *   in HDLC-Lite (See Appendix A.1.2).  When both of the "CRC" bits are
 *   set, both sides must verify that the "CRC" is valid before accepting
 *   the frame.  If not enough bytes were clocked out for the CRC to be
 *   read, then the frame must be ignored.  If enough bytes were clocked
 *   out to perform a CRC check, but the CRC check fails, then the frame
 *   must be rejected and the "CRC_FAIL" bit on the next frame (and ONLY
 *   the next frame) MUST be set.
