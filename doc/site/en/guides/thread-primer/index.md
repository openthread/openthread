<a href="http://threadgroup.org/">Thread<sup>®</sup></a> is an IPv6-based
networking protocol designed for low-power Internet of Things devices in an IEEE
802.15.4-2006 wireless mesh network, commonly called a Wireless Personal Area
Network (WPAN). Thread is independent of other 802.15.4 mesh networking
protocols, such a ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth LE.

Thread's primary features include:

*   Simplicity — Simple installation, start up, and operation
*   Security — All devices in a Thread network are authenticated and all
    communications are encrypted
*   Reliability — Self-healing mesh networking, with no single point of failure,
    and spread-spectrum techniques to provide immunity to interference
*   Efficiency — Low-power Thread devices can sleep and operate on battery power
    for years
*   Scalability — Thread networks can scale up to hundreds of devices

If you're new to Thread, understanding the basics are critical to using
OpenThread in your own applications. The goal of this primer is to explain the
concepts behind Thread and how it works, and provide a springboard to OpenThread
development.

It is assumed you have good working knowledge of the following:

*   IEEE 802.15.4
*   Networking and routing concepts
*   IPv6

This primer is based on version 1.1.1 of the Thread Specification. It does not
cover the full specification, which is available at
[threadgroup.org](http://threadgroup.org/ThreadSpec).
