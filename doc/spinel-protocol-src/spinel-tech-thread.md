# Technology: Thread(R) {#tech-thread}

This section describes all of the properties and semantics required
for managing a Thread(R) NCP.

Thread(R) NCPs have the following requirements:

* The property `PROP_INTERFACE_TYPE` must be 3.
* The non-optional properties in the following sections **MUST** be
  implemented: CORE, PHY, MAC, NET, and IPV6.

All serious implementations of an NCP **SHOULD** also support the network
save feature (See (#feature-network-save)).

## Capabilities {#thread-caps}

The Thread(R) technology defines the following capabilities:

* `CAP_NET_THREAD_1_0` - Indicates that the NCP implements v1.0 of the Thread(R) standard.
* `CAP_NET_THREAD_1_1` - Indicates that the NCP implements v1.1 of the Thread(R) standard.

## Properties {#thread-properties}

Properties for Thread(R) are allocated out of the `Tech` property
section (see (#property-sections)).

value must follow the format associated with the corresponding spinel
property.

On write, any unknown/unsupported property keys must be ignored.
