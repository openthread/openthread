.# Abstract

This document describes a general management protocol for enabling a host
device to communicate with and manage a Network Control Processor (NCP).

While initially designed to support Thread-based NCPs, the NCP protocol
has been designed with a layered approach that allows it to be easily
adapted to other network technologies in the future.

# Introduction #

This Network Control Processor (NCP) protocol was designed to enable a
host device to communicate with and manage a NCP while also achieving
the following goals:

*   Adopt a layered approach to the protocol design, allowing future
    support for other network protocols.
*   Minimize the number of required commands/methods by providing a
    rich, property-based API.
*   Support NCPs capable of being connected to more than one network
    at a time.
*   Gracefully handle the addition of new features and capabilities
    without necessarily breaking backward compatibility.
*   Be as minimal and light-weight as possible without unnecessarily
    sacrificing flexibility.

On top of this core framework, we define the properties and commands
to enable various features and network protocols.

## About this Draft ##

This document is currently in a draft status and is changing often.
This section discusses some ideas for changes to the protocol that
haven't yet been fully specified, as well as some of the impetus for
the current design.

### Renumbering ###

Efforts are currently maintained to try to prevent overtly
backward-incompatible changes to the existing protocol, but if you are
implementing Spinel in your own products you should expect there to be
at least one large renumbering event and major version number change
before the standard is considered "baked". All changes will be clearly
marked and documented to make such a transition as easy as possible.

To allow conclusive detection of protocol (in)compatibility between
the host and the NCP, the following commands and properties are
already considered to be "baked" and will not change:

*   Command IDs zero through eight. (Reset, No-op, and Property-Value
    Commands)
*   Property IDs zero through two. (Last status, Protocol Version, and
    NCP Version)

Renumbering would be undertaken in order to better organize the
allocation of property IDs and capability IDs. One of the initial
goals of this protocol was for it to be possible for a host or NCP to
only implement properties with values less than 127 and for the NCP to
still be usable---relegating all larger property values for extra
features or other capabilities that aren't strictly necessary. This
would allow simple implementations to avoid the need to implement
support for PUIs ((#packed-unsigned-integer)).

As time has gone by and the protocol has become more fleshed out, it
has become clear that some of the initial allocations were inadequate
and should be revisited if we want to try to achieve the original
goal.

### Spinel as Application API ###

The current primary host driver implementation is
[wpantund](http://wpantund.org/). wpantund manages the NCP using the
Spinel protocol and provides a management API for the application using
[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) IPC.

However, some thought has been given to the idea of having a host
driver daemon which uses Spinel directly as the management API. You
would have user-space daemon similar to wpantund which would
communicate directly with the NCP. Using Unix Domain Sockets,
applications could connect to the daemon by opening a special socket
file. The protocol for that socket might be (for example)
HDLC-Lite-encoded ((#hdlc-lite)) spinel frames, as if the application
were talking directly to the NCP.

Applications aren't necessarily interested in everything that an NCP
would normally send out unsolicited, so a mechanism for specifying
which properties should be listened to would need to be defined. This
mechanism would not be implemented by the NCP but would instead be
implemented by the daemon to control which notification packets need
to be directed where.

In the event of transaction ID collisions, the daemon would
transparently renumber spinel frames so as to not cause TID
collisions.

Since there can be more than one application that is using the API at
a time, the `PROP_LOCK` property ((#prop-lock)) would be used to
ensure exclusive access to the NCP by an application. Only one process
would be allowed to enable the lock at a time.

Such a IPC mechanism would be desirable because it is, from a spinel
perspective, future proof. New features can be added and new
properties assigned and the IPC protocol would not need to be extended
to support them. It is also simple and has no external dependencies
other than unix domain sockets.

Security is obviously paramount in a system like this, so a great deal
of care should be taken to make sure that certain commands and
properties cannot be executed or changed without the appropriate
privileges.

### Privileged Commands and Properties ###

The idea here is that some commands should be considered "privileged",
and actively prevented from letting normal applications access them.
This is important if the IPC protocol between the application and the
NCP is Spinel.

Examples of such privileged commands would be debugging commands like
"peek" or "poke", properties which control bootloader behavior, or
changing factory-specified constants. These commands should have some
attribute about them that can be easily filtered to prevent
applications from using issuing them directly to the NCP.

This would likely be implemented as a part of the renumbering effort
((#renumbering)).

## Property Overview ##

Spinel is largely a property-based protocol, with a property defined
for every attribute that needs to be set, changed, or known by the
host. The inspiration of this approach was memory-mapped hardware
registers for peripherals. The goal is to avoid, as much as possible,
the use of large complicated structures and/or method argument lists.
The reason for avoiding these is because they have a tendency to
change, especially early in development. Adding or removing a property
from a structure can render the entire protocol incompatible. By using
properties, you simply change an additional property.

Almost all features and capabilities are implemented using properties.
Most new features that are initially proposed as commands can be
adapted to be property-based instead. Notable exceptions include "Host
Buffer Offload" ((#feature-host-buffer-offload)) and "Network Save"
((#feature-network-save)).

In Spinel, properties are keyed by an unsigned integer between 0 and
2,097,151 (See (#packed-unsigned-integer)).

### Property Methods ###

Properties may support one or more of the following methods:

*   `VALUE_GET`
*   `VALUE_SET`
*   `VALUE_INSERT`
*   `VALUE_REMOVE`

Additionally, the NCP can send updates to the host (either
synchronously or asynchronously) that inform the host about changes to
specific properties:

*   `VALUE_IS`
*   `VALUE_INSERTED`
*   `VALUE_REMOVED`

### Property Types ###

Conceptually, there are three different types of properties:

*   Single-value properties
*   Multiple-value (Array) properties
*   Stream properties

#### Single-Value Properties ####

Single-value properties are properties that have a simple
representation of a single value. Examples would be:

*   Current radio channel (Represented as a unsigned 8-bit integer)
*   Network name (Represented as a UTF-8 encoded string)
*   802\.15.4 PAN ID (Represented as a unsigned 16-bit integer)

The valid operations on these sorts of properties are `GET` and `SET`.

#### Multiple-Value Properties ####

Multiple-Value Properties have more than one value associated with
them. Examples would be:

*   List of channels supported by the radio hardware.
*   List of IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface.
*   List of capabilities supported by the NCP.

The valid operations on these sorts of properties are `VALUE_GET`,
`VALUE_SET`, `VALUE_INSERT`, and `VALUE_REMOVE`.

When the value is fetched using `VALUE_GET`, the returned value is the
concatenation of all of the individual values in the list. If the
length of the value for an individual item in the list is not defined
by the type then each item returned in the list is prepended with a
length (See (#arrays)). The order of the returned items, unless
explicitly defined for that specific property, is undefined.

`VALUE_SET` provides a way to completely replace all previous values.
Calling `VALUE_SET` with an empty value effectively instructs the NCP
to clear the value of that property.

`VALUE_INSERT` and `VALUE_REMOVE` provide mechanisms for the insertion
or removal of individual items *by value*. The payload for these
commands is a plain single value.

#### Stream Properties ####

Stream properties are special properties representing streams of data.
Examples would be:

*   Network packet stream ((#prop-stream-net))
*   Raw packet stream ((#prop-stream-raw))
*   Debug message stream ((#prop-stream-debug))
*   Network Beacon stream ((#prop-mac-scan-beacon))

All such properties emit changes asynchronously using the `VALUE_IS`
command, sent from the NCP to the host. For example, as IPv6 traffic
is received by the NCP, the IPv6 packets are sent to the host by way
of asynchronous `VALUE_IS` notifications.

Some of these properties also support the host send data back to the
NCP. For example, this is how the host sends IPv6 traffic to the NCP.

These types of properties generally do not support `VALUE_GET`, as it
is meaningless.
