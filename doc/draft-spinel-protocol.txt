                    Spinel Host-Controller Protocol
                     draft-spinel-protocol-94724cf

Abstract

   This document describes a general management protocol for enabling a
   host device to communicate with and manage a Network Control
   Processor (NCP).

   While initially designed to support Thread-based NCPs, the NCP
   protocol has been designed with a layered approach that allows it to
   be easily adapted to other network technologies in the future.

1.  Introduction

   This Network Control Processor (NCP) protocol was designed to enable
   a host device to communicate with and manage a NCP while also
   achieving the following goals:

   o  Adopt a layered approach to the protocol design, allowing future
      support for other network protocols.
   o  Minimize the number of required commands/methods by providing a
      rich, property-based API.
   o  Support NCPs capable of being connected to more than one network
      at a time.
   o  Gracefully handle the addition of new features and capabilities
      without necessarily breaking backward compatibility.
   o  Be as minimal and light-weight as possible without unnecessarily
      sacrificing flexibility.

   On top of this core framework, we define the properties and commands
   to enable various features and network protocols.

2.  Definitions

   NCP
      Acryonym for Network Control Processor.

3.1.  Header Format

   The header byte is broken down as follows:

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     |  FLG  |  IID  |      TID      |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   [CREF1]

3.1.1.  FLG: Flag

   The flag field of the header byte ("FLG") is always set to the value
   two (or "10" in binary).  Any frame received with these bits set to
   any other value else MUST NOT be considered a Spinel frame.

   This convention allows Spinel to be line compatible with BTLE HCI.
   By defining the first two bit in this way we can disambiguate between
   Spinel frames and HCI frames (which always start with either "0x01"
   or "0x04") without any additional framing overhead.

3.1.2.  IID: Interface Identifier

   The Interface Identifier (IID) is a number between 0 and 3 which
   identifies which subinterface the frame is intended for.  This allows
   the protocol to support connecting to more than one network at once.
   The first subinterface (0) is considered the primary subinterface and
   MUST be supported.  Support for all other subinterfaces is OPTIONAL.

3.1.3.  TID: Transaction Identifier

   The least significant bits of the header represent the Transaction
   Identifier(TID).  The TID is used for correlating responses to the
   commands which generated them.

   When a command is sent from the host, any reply to that command sent
   by the NCP will use the same value for the TID.  When the host
   receives a frame that matches the TID of the command it sent, it can
   easily recognize that frame as the actual response to that command.

   The TID value of zero (0) is used for commands to which a correlated
   response is not expected or needed, such as for unsolicited update
   commands sent to the host from the NCP.

3.1.4.  Command Identifier (CMD)

   The command identifier is a 21-bit unsigned integer encoded in up to
   three bytes using the packed unsigned integer format described in
   Section 4.2.  This encoding allows for up to 2,097,152 individual
   commands, with the first 127 commands represented as a single byte.
   Command identifiers larger than 2,097,151 are explicitly forbidden.

          +-----------------------+----------------------------+

3.1.5.  Command Payload (Optional)

   Depending on the semantics of the command in question, a payload MAY
   be included in the frame.  The exact composition and length of the
   payload is defined by the command identifier.

4.  Data Packing

   Data serialization for properties is performed using a light-weight
   data packing format which was loosely inspired by D-Bus.  The format
   of a serialization is defined by a specially formatted string.

   Goals:

   o  Be lightweight and favor direct representation of values.
   o  Use an easily readable and memorable format string.
   o  Support lists and structures.
   o  Allow properties to be appended to structures while maintaining
      backward compatibility.

   Each primitive datatype has an ASCII character associated with it.
   Structures can be represented as strings of these characters.  For
   example:

   o  "C": A single unsigned byte.
   o  "C6U": A single unsigned byte, followed by a 128-bit IPv6 address,
      followed by a zero-terminated UTF8 string.
   o  "A(6)": An array of IPv6 addresses

   In each case, the data is represented exactly as described.  For
   example, an array of 10 IPv6 address is stored as 160 bytes.

   All multi-byte values are little-endian unless explicitly stated
   otherwise.

4.2.  Packed Unsigned Integer

   For certain types of integers, such command or property identifiers,
   usually have a value on the wire that is less than 127.  However, in
   order to not preclude the use of values larger than 255, we would
   need to add an extra byte.  Doing this would add an extra byte to the
   vast majority of instances, which can add up in terms of bandwidth.

   The packed unsigned integer format is based on the unsigned integer
   format in EXI [1], except that we limit the maximum value to the
   largest value that can be encoded into three bytes(2,097,151).

   For all values less than 127, the packed form of the number is simply
   a single byte which directly represents the number.  For values
   larger than 127, the following process is used to encode the value:






Quattlebaum              Expires March 13, 2017                 [Page 9]

   1.  The unsigned integer is broken up into _n_ 7-bit chunks and
       placed into _n_ octets, leaving the most significant bit of each
       octet unused.
   2.  Order the octets from least-significant to most-significant.
       (Little-endian)
   3.  Clear the most significant bit of the most significant octet.
       Set the least significant bit on all other octets.

   Where _n_ is the smallest number of 7-bit chunks you can use to
   represent the given value.

   Take the value 1337, for example:

                              1337 => 0x0539
                                   => [39 0A]
                                   => [B9 0A]

   To decode the value, you collect the 7-bit chunks until you find an
   octet with the most significant bit clear.

4.3.  Data Blobs

   Data blobs are special datatypes in that the data that they contain
   does not inherently define the size of the data.  This means that if
   the length of the data blob isn't _implied_, then the length of the
   blob must be prepended as a packed unsigned integer.

   The length of a data blob is _implied_ only when it is the last
   datatype in a given buffer.  This works because we already know the
   size of the buffer, and the length of the data is simply the rest of
   the size of the buffer.

   For example, let's say we have a buffer that is encoded with the
   datatype signature of "CLLD".  In this case, it is pretty easy to
   tell where the start and end of the data blob is: the start is 9
   bytes from the start of the buffer, and its length is the length of
   the buffer minus 9. (9 is the number of bytes taken up by a byte and
   two longs)

   However, things are a little different with "CLDL".  Since our data
   blob is no longer the last item in the signature, the length must be
   prepended.

   If you are a little confused, keep reading.  This theme comes up in a
   a few different ways in the following sections.

   When a length is prepended, the length is encoded as a little-endian
   unsigned 16-bit integer.

      Originally the length was a Section 4.2, but it was changed to an
      unsigned 16-bit integer in order to help reduce protocol
      requirements.

4.4.  Structured Data

   The structured data type is a way of bundling together a bunch of
   data into a single data structure.  This may at first seem useless.
   What is the difference between "T(Cii)" and just "Cii"?  The answer
   is, in that particular case, nothing: they are stored in exactly the
   same way.

   However, one case where the structure datatype makes a difference is
   when you compare "T(Cii)L" to "CiiL": they end up being represented
   entirely differently.  This is because the structured data type
   follows the exact same semantics as the data blob type: if it isn't
   the last datatype in a signature, _it must be prepended with a
   length_. This is useful because it allows for new datatypes to be
   appended to the structure's signature while remaining _backward
   parsing compatibility_.

   More explicitly, if you take data that was encoded with "T(Cii6)L",
   you can still decode it as "T(Cii)L".

   Let's take, for example, the property "PROP_IPv6_ADDR_TABLE".
   Conceptually it is just a list of IPv6 addresses, so we can encode it
   as "A(6c)".  However, if we ever want to associate more data with the
   type (like flags), we break our backward compatibility if we add
   another member and use "A(6cC)".  To allow for data to be added
   without breaking backward compatibility, we use the structured data
   type from the start: "A(T(6c))".  Then when we add a new member to
   the structure ("A(T(6cC))"), we don't break backward compatibility.

   It's also worth noting that "T(Cii)L" also parses as "DL".  You could
   then take the resultant data blob and parse it as "Cii".

   When a length is prepended, the length is encoded as a little-endian
   unsigned 16-bit integer.

4.5.  Arrays

   An array is simply a concatenated set of _n_ data encodings.  For
   example, the type "A(6)" is simply a list of IPv6 addresses---one
   after the other.

   Just like the data blob type and the structured data type, the length
   of the entire array must be prepended _unless_ the array is the last

   type in a given signature.  Thus, "A(C)" (An array of unsigned bytes)
   encodes identically to "D".

   When a length is prepended, the length is encoded as a little-endian
   unsigned 16-bit integer.

6.  Properties

   While the majority of the properties that allow the configuration of
   network connectivity are network protocol specific, there are several
   properties that are required in all implementations.

   Future property allocations SHALL be made from the following
   allocation plan:

    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | Property ID Range     | Description                             |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | 0 - 127               | Reserved for frequently-used properties |
    | 128 - 15,359          | Unallocated                             |
    | 15,360 - 16,383       | Vendor-specific                         |
    | 16,384 - 1,999,999    | Unallocated                             |
    | 2,000,000 - 2,097,151 | Experimental use only                   |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+

   For an explanation of the data format encoding shorthand used
   throughout this document, see Section 4.

6.1.  Property Sections

   The currently assigned properties are broken up into several
   sections, each with reserved ranges of property identifiers.  These
   ranges are:

      +--------+------------------------------+---------------------+
      |  Name  |      Range (Inclusive)       |    Documentation    |
      +--------+------------------------------+---------------------+
      |  Core  | 0x00 - 0x1F, 0x1000 - 0x11FF |     Section 6.2     |
      |  PHY   | 0x20 - 0x2F, 0x1200 - 0x12FF |     Section 6.3     |
      |  MAC   | 0x30 - 0x3F, 0x1300 - 0x13FF |     Section 6.4     |
      |  NET   | 0x40 - 0x4F, 0x1400 - 0x14FF |     Section 6.5     |
      |  Tech  | 0x50 - 0x5F, 0x1500 - 0x15FF | Technology-specific |
      |  IPv6  | 0x60 - 0x6F, 0x1600 - 0x16FF |     Section 6.6     |
      | Stream | 0x70 - 0x7F, 0x1700 - 0x17FF |     Section 6.2     |
      +--------+------------------------------+---------------------+

   Note that each property section has two reserved ranges: a primary
   range (which is encoded as a single byte) and an extended range
   (which is encoded as two bytes). properties which are used more
   frequently are generally allocated from the former range.

6.2.  Core Properties

6.2.1.  PROP 0: PROP_LAST_STATUS

   o  Type: Read-Only
   o  Encoding: "i"

                         +---------+-------------+
                         | Octets: |     1-3     |
                         +---------+-------------+
                         | Fields: | LAST_STATUS |
                         +---------+-------------+

   Describes the status of the last operation.  Encoded as a packed
   unsigned integer.

   This property is emitted often to indicate the result status of
   pretty much any Host-to-NCP operation.

   It is emitted automatically at NCP startup with a value indicating
   the reset reason.

   See Section 7 for the complete list of status codes.

6.2.2.  PROP 1: PROP_PROTOCOL_VERSION

   o  Type: Read-Only
   o  Encoding: "ii"

                +---------+---------------+---------------+
                | Octets: |      1-3      |      1-3      |
                +---------+---------------+---------------+
                | Fields: | MAJOR_VERSION | MINOR_VERSION |
                +---------+---------------+---------------+

   Describes the protocol version information.  This property contains
   four fields, each encoded as a packed unsigned integer:

   o  Major Version Number
   o  Minor Version Number

   This document describes major version 4, minor version 1 of this
   protocol.

6.2.2.1.  Major Version Number

   The major version number is used to identify large and incompatible
   differences between protocol versions.

   The host MUST enter a FAULT state if it does not explicitly support
   the given major version number.

6.2.2.2.  Minor Version Number

   The minor version number is used to identify small but otherwise
   compatible differences between protocol versions.  A mismatch between
   the advertised minor version number and the minor version that is
   supported by the host SHOULD NOT be fatal to the operation of the
   host.

6.2.3.  PROP 2: PROP_NCP_VERSION

   o  Type: Read-Only
   o  Packed-Encoding: "U"

                      +---------+-------------------+

                      +---------+-------------------+
                      | Fields: | NCP_VESION_STRING |
                      +---------+-------------------+

   Contains a string which describes the firmware currently running on
   the NCP.  Encoded as a zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

   The format of the string is not strictly defined, but it is intended
   to present similarly to the "User-Agent" string from HTTP.  The
   RECOMMENDED format of the string is as follows:

 STACK-NAME/STACK-VERSION[BUILD_INFO][; OTHER_INFO]; BUILD_DATE_AND_TIME

   Examples:

   o  "OpenThread/1.0d26-25-gb684c7f; DEBUG; May 9 2016 18:22:04"
   o  "ConnectIP/2.0b125 s1 ALPHA; Sept 24 2015 20:49:19"

   This integer identifies what the network protocol for this NCP.
   Currently defined values are:

   o  1: ZigBee
   o  2: ZigBeeIP
   o  3: Thread

   The host MUST enter a FAULT state if it does not recognize the
   protocol given by the NCP.

6.2.5.  PROP 4: PROP_INTERFACE_VENDOR_ID

   o  Type: Read-Only
   o  Encoding: "i"

                          +---------+-----------+

                         +---------+-------------+

   Describes the current power state of the NCP.  By writing to this
   property you can manage the lower state of the NCP.  Enumeration is
   encoded as a single unsigned byte.

   Defined values are:

   o  0: "POWER_STATE_OFFLINE": NCP is physically powered off.
      (Enumerated for completeness sake, not expected on the wire)
   o  1: "POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP": Almost everything on the NCP is shut
      down, but can still be resumed via a command or interrupt.
   o  2: "POWER_STATE_STANDBY": NCP is in the lowest power state that
      can still be awoken by an event from the radio (e.g. waiting for
      alarm)
   o  3: "POWER_STATE_LOW_POWER": NCP is responsive (and possibly
      connected), but using less power. (e.g.  "Sleepy" child node)

                            +---------+------+

   Property lock.  Used for grouping changes to several properties to
   take effect at once, or to temporarily prevent the automatic updating
   of property values.  When this property is set, the execution of the
   NCP is effectively frozen until it is cleared.

   This property is only supported if the "CAP_LOCK" capability is
   present.

   Unlike most other properties, setting this property to true when the
   value of the property is already true MUST fail with a last status of
   "STATUS_ALREADY".

6.2.11.  PROP 112: PROP_STREAM_DEBUG

                          +---------+-----------+

   This property is a streaming property, meaning that you cannot
   explicitly fetch the value of this property.  The stream provides
   human-readable debugging output which may be displayed in the host
   logs.

   The location of newline characters is not assumed by the host: it is
   the NCP's responsibility to insert newline characters where needed,
   just like with any other text stream.

   To receive the debugging stream, you wait for "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS"
   commands for this property from the NCP.

        | Fields: | FRAME_DATA_LEN | FRAME_DATA | FRAME_METADATA |
        +---------+----------------+------------+----------------+

   This stream provides the capability of sending and receiving raw
   packets to and from the radio.  The exact format of the frame
   metadata and data is dependent on the MAC and PHY being used.

   This property is a streaming property, meaning that you cannot
   explicitly fetch the value of this property.  To receive traffic, you
   wait for "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" commands with this property id from the
   NCP.

   Implementations may optionally support the ability to transmit
   arbitrary raw packets.  If this capability is supported, you may call
   "CMD_PROP_VALUE_SET" on this property with the value of the raw
   packet.

   Any data past the end of "FRAME_DATA_LEN" is considered metadata.
   The format of the metadata is defined by the associated MAC and PHY
   being used, and typically includes RSSI/TX-Power, LQI, etc.

7.  Status Codes

   Status codes are sent from the NCP to the host via "PROP_LAST_STATUS"
   using the "CMD_VALUE_IS" command to indicate the return status of a
   previous command.  As with any response, the TID field of the FLAG
   byte is used to correlate the response with the request.

   Note that most successfully executed commands do not indicate a last
   status of "STATUS_OK".  The usual way the NCP indicates a successful
   command is to mirror the property change back to the host.  For
   example, if you do a "CMD_VALUE_SET" on "PROP_PHY_ENABLED", the NCP

Appendix A.  Framing Protocol

   Since this NCP protocol is defined independently of the physical
   transport or framing, any number of transports and framing protocols
   could be used successfully.  However, in the interests of
   compatibility, this document provides some recommendations.

A.1.  UART Recommendations

   The recommended default UART settings are:

   o  Bit rate: 115200
   o  Start bits: 1
   o  Data bits: 8
   o  Stop bits: 1
   o  Parity: None
   o  Flow Control: Hardware

   These values may be adjusted depending on the individual needs of the
   application or product, but some sort of flow control MUST be used.
   Hardware flow control is preferred over software flow control.  In
   the absence of hardware flow control, software flow control (XON/
   XOFF) MUST be used instead.

   We also *RECOMMEND* an arduino-style hardware reset, where the DTR
   signal is coupled to the "R&#773;E&#773;S&#773;" pin through a
   0.01[micro]F capacitor.  This causes the NCP to automatically reset
   whenever the serial port is opened.  At the very least we *RECOMMEND*

   dedicating one of your host pins to controlling the
   "R&#773;E&#773;S&#773;" pin on the NCP, so that you can easily
   perform a hardware reset if necessary.

A.1.1.  HDLC-Lite

   _HDLC-Lite_ is the recommended framing protocol for transmitting
   Spinel frames over a UART.  HDLC-Lite consists of only the framing,
   escaping, and CRC parts of the larger HDLC protocol---all other parts
   of HDLC are omitted.  This protocol was chosen because it works well
   with software flow control and is widely implemented.

   To transmit a frame with HDLC-lite, the 16-bit CRC must first be
   appended to the frame.  The CRC function is defined to be CRC-16/
   CCITT, otherwise known as the KERMIT CRC [2].

   Individual frames are terminated with a frame delimiter octet called
   the 'flag' octet ("0x7E").

   The following octets values are considered _special_ and should be
   escaped when present in data frames:

                 +-------------+------------------------+
                 | Octet Value |      Description       |
                 +-------------+------------------------+
                 |     0x7E    | Frame Delimiter (Flag) |
                 |     0x7D    |      Escape Byte       |
                 |     0x11    |          XON           |
                 |     0x13    |          XOFF          |
                 |     0xF8    |    Vendor-Specific     |
                 +-------------+------------------------+

   When present in a data frame, these octet values are escaped by
   prepending the escape octet ("0x7D") and XORing the value with
   "0x20".

   When receiving a frame, the CRC must be verified after the frame is
   unescaped.  If the CRC value does not match what is calculated for
   the frame data, the frame MUST be discarded.  The implementation MAY
   indicate the failure to higher levels to handle as they see fit, but
   MUST NOT attempt to process the deceived frame.

   Consecutive flag octets are entirely legal and MUST NOT be treated as
   a framing error.  Consecutive flag octets MAY be used as a way to
   wake up a sleeping NCP.

   When first establishing a connection to the NCP, it is customary to
   send one or more flag octets to ensure that any previously received
   data is discarded.

A.2.  SPI Recommendations

   We RECOMMEND the use of the following standard SPI signals:

   o  "C&#773;S&#773;": (Host-to-NCP) Chip Select
   o  "CLK": (Host-to-NCP) Clock
   o  "MOSI": Master-Output/Slave-Input
   o  "MISO": Master-Input/Slave-Output
   o  "I&#773;N&#773;T&#773;": (NCP-to-Host) Host Interrupt
   o  "R&#773;E&#773;S&#773;": (Host-to-NCP) NCP Hardware Reset

   The "I&#773;N&#773;T&#773;" signal is used by the NCP to indicate to
   the host that the NCP has frames pending to send to it.  When
   asserted, the host SHOULD initiate a SPI transaction in a timely
   manner.

   We RECOMMEND the following SPI properties:

   o  "C&#773;S&#773;" is active low.
   o  "CLK" is active high.
   o  "CLK" speed is larger than 500 kHz.
   o  Data is valid on leading edge of "CLK".
   o  Data is sent in multiples of 8-bits (octets).
   o  Octets are sent most-significant bit first.

   This recommended configuration may be adjusted depending on the
   individual needs of the application or product.

A.2.1.  SPI Framing Protocol

   Each SPI frame starts with a 5-byte frame header:

                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+
                  | Octets: |  1  |    2     |    2     |
                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+
                  | Fields: | HDR | RECV_LEN | DATA_LEN |
                  +---------+-----+----------+----------+

   o  "HDR": The first byte is the header byte (defined below)
   o  "RECV_LEN": The second and third bytes indicate the largest frame
      size that that device is ready to receive.  If zero, then the
      other device must not send any data.  (Little endian)
   o  "DATA_LEN": The fourth and fifth bytes indicate the size of the
      pending data frame to be sent to the other device.  If this value



Quattlebaum              Expires March 13, 2017                [Page 35]

                        Spinel Protocol (94724cf)         September 2016


      is equal-to or less-than the number of bytes that the other device
      is willing to receive, then the data of the frame is immediately
      after the header.  (Little Endian)

   The "HDR" byte is defined as:

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     |RST|CRC|    RESERVED   |PATTERN|
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   o  "RST": This bit is set when that device has been reset since the
      last time "C&#773;S&#773;" was asserted.
   o  "CRC": This bit is set when that device supports writing a 16-bit
      CRC at the end of the data.  This CRC is NOT included in DATA_LEN.
   o  "RESERVED": These bits are all reserved for future used.  They
      MUST be cleared to zero and MUST be ignored if set.
   o  "PATTERN": These bits are set to a fixed value to help distinguish
      valid SPI frames from garbage (by explicitly making "0xFF" and
      "0x00" invalid values).  Bit 6 MUST be set to be one and bit 7
      MUST be cleared (0).  A frame received that has any other values
      for these bits MUST be dropped.

   Prior to a sending or receiving a frame, the master SHOULD send a
   5-octet frame with zeros for both the max receive frame size and the
   the contained frame length.  This will induce the slave device to
   indicate the length of the frame it wants to send (if any) and
   indicate the largest frame it is capable of receiving at the moment.
   This allows the master to calculate the size of the next transaction.

   This protocol can be used either unidirectionally or bidirectionally,
   determined by the behavior of the master and the slave.

   If the the master notices "PATTERN" is not set correctly, the master
   should consider the transaction to have failed and try again after 10
   milliseconds, retrying up to 200 times.  After unsuccessfully trying
   200 times in a row, the master MAY take appropriate remedial action
   (like a NCP hardware reset, or indicating a communication failure to
   a user interface).

Appendix B.  Feature: Network Save

   The network save feature is an optional NCP capability that, when
   present, allows the host to save and recall network credentials and
   state to and from nonvolatile storage.

   The presence of this feature can be detected by checking for the
   presence of the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability in "PROP_CAPS".

B.1.  Commands

B.1.1.  CMD 9: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_SAVE

                    +---------+--------+--------------+
                    | Octets: |   1    |      1       |
                    +---------+--------+--------------+
                    | Fields: | HEADER | CMD_NET_SAVE |
                    +---------+--------+--------------+

   Save network state command.  Saves any current network credentials
   and state necessary to reconnect to the current network to non-
   volatile memory.

   This operation affects non-volatile memory only.  The current network
   information stored in volatile memory is unaffected.

   The response to this command is always a "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" for
   "PROP_LAST_STATUS", indicating the result of the operation.

   This command is only available if the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability is
   set.

B.1.2.  CMD 10: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_CLEAR

                   +---------+--------+---------------+
                   | Octets: |   1    |       1       |
                   +---------+--------+---------------+
                   | Fields: | HEADER | CMD_NET_CLEAR |
                   +---------+--------+---------------+

   Clear saved network state command.  Clears any previously saved
   network credentials and state previously stored by "CMD_NET_SAVE"
   from non-volatile memory.

B.1.3.  CMD 11: (Host->NCP) CMD_NET_RECALL

                   +---------+--------+----------------+
                   | Octets: |   1    |       1        |

                   | Fields: | HEADER | CMD_NET_RECALL |
                   +---------+--------+----------------+

   Recall saved network state command.  Recalls any previously saved
   network credentials and state previously stored by "CMD_NET_SAVE"
   from non-volatile memory.

   This command will typically generated several unsolicited property
   updates as the network state is loaded.  At the conclusion of
   loading, the authoritative response to this command is always a
   "CMD_PROP_VALUE_IS" for "PROP_LAST_STATUS", indicating the result of
   the operation.

   This command is only available if the "CAP_NET_SAVE" capability is
   set.

Appendix C.  Feature: Host Buffer Offload

   The memory on an NCP may be much more limited than the memory on the
   host processor.  In such situations, it is sometimes useful for the
   NCP to offload buffers to the host processor temporarily so that it
   can perform other operations.

   Host buffer offload is an optional NCP capability that, when present,
   allows the NCP to store data buffers on the host processor that can
   be recalled at a later time.

   The presence of this feature can be detected by the host by checking
   for the presence of the "CAP_HBO" capability in "PROP_CAPS".

Appendix F.  Example Sessions

F.1.  NCP Initialization

   [CREF7]

   Check the protocol version to see if it is supported:

   o  CMD_VALUE_GET:PROP_PROTOCOL_VERSION
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_PROTOCOL_VERSION

   Check the NCP version to see if a firmware update may be necessary:

   o  CMD_VALUE_GET:PROP_NCP_VERSION
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NCP_VERSION

   Check interface type to make sure that it is what we expect:

   o  CMD_VALUE_GET:PROP_INTERFACE_TYPE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_INTERFACE_TYPE

   If the host supports using vendor-specific commands, the vendor
   should be verified before using them:

   o  CMD_VALUE_GET:PROP_VENDOR_ID
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_VENDOR_ID

   Fetch the capability list so that we know what features this NCP
   supports:

   o  CMD_VALUE_GET:PROP_CAPS
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_CAPS

   If the NCP supports CAP_NET_SAVE, then we go ahead and recall the
   network:

   o  CMD_NET_RECALL

F.2.  Attaching to a network

   [CREF8]

   We make the assumption that the NCP is not currently associated with
   a network.

   Set the network properties, if they were not already set:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_PHY_CHAN

                        Spinel Protocol (94724cf)         September 2016


   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_PHY_CHAN
   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_XPANID
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_XPANID
   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_MAC_15_4_PANID
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_MAC_15_4_PANID
   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_NETWORK_NAME
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_NETWORK_NAME
   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_MASTER_KEY
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_MASTER_KEY
   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_KEY_SEQUENCE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_KEY_SEQUENCE

   Bring the network interface up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_IF_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_IF_UP:TRUE

   Bring the routing stack up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE

   Some asynchronous events from the NCP:

   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_ROLE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_PARTITION_ID
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_THREAD_ON_MESH_NETS

F.3.  Successfully joining a pre-existing network

   [CREF9]

   This example session is identical to the above session up to the
   point where we set PROP_NET_IF_UP to true.  From there, the behavior
   changes.

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_REQUIRE_JOIN_EXISTING:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_REQUIRE_JOIN_EXISTING:TRUE

   Bring the routing stack up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE

   Some asynchronous events from the NCP:

   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_ROLE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_PARTITION_ID

                        Spinel Protocol (94724cf)         September 2016


   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_THREAD_ON_MESH_NETS

   Now let's save the network settings to NVRAM:

   o  CMD_NET_SAVE

F.4.  Unsuccessfully joining a pre-existing network

   This example session is identical to the above session up to the
   point where we set PROP_NET_IF_UP to true.  From there, the behavior
   changes.

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_REQUIRE_JOIN_EXISTING:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_REQUIRE_JOIN_EXISTING:TRUE

   Bring the routing stack up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE

   Some asynchronous events from the NCP:

   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_LAST_STATUS:STATUS_JOIN_NO_PEERS
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:FALSE

F.5.  Detaching from a network

   TBD

F.6.  Attaching to a saved network

   [CREF10]

   Recall the saved network if you haven't already done so:

   o  CMD_NET_RECALL

   Bring the network interface up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_IF_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_IF_UP:TRUE

   Bring the routing stack up:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_STACK_UP:TRUE

   Some asynchronous events from the NCP:

   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_ROLE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_NET_PARTITION_ID
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_THREAD_ON_MESH_NETS

F.7.  NCP Software Reset

   [CREF11]

   o  CMD_RESET
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_LAST_STATUS:STATUS_RESET_SOFTWARE

   Then jump to Appendix F.1.

F.8.  Adding an on-mesh prefix

   TBD

F.9.  Entering low-power modes

   TBD

F.10.  Sniffing raw packets

   [CREF12]

   This assuems that the NCP has been initialized.

   Optionally set the channel:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_PHY_CHAN:x
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_PHY_CHAN

   Set the filter mode:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_MAC_FILTER_MODE:MAC_FILTER_MODE_MONITOR
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_MAC_FILTER_MODE:MAC_FILTER_MODE_MONITOR

   Enable the raw stream:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_MAC_RAW_STREAM_ENABLED:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_MAC_RAW_STREAM_ENABLED:TRUE

   Enable the PHY directly:

   o  CMD_VALUE_SET:PROP_PHY_ENABLED:TRUE
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_PHY_ENABLED:TRUE

   Now we will get raw 802.15.4 packets asynchronously on
   PROP_STREAM_RAW:

   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_STREAM_RAW:...
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_STREAM_RAW:...
   o  CMD_VALUE_IS:PROP_STREAM_RAW:...

   This mode may be entered even when associated with a network.  In
   that case, you should set "PROP_MAC_FILTER_MODE" to
   "MAC_FILTER_MODE_PROMISCUOUS" or "MAC_FILTER_MODE_NORMAL", so that
   you can avoid receiving packets from other networks or that are
   destined for other nodes.

Editorial Comments

[CREF1] RQ: We may want to consider a license more appropriate for
        documentation.
