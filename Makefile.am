#                    version of the package.
#
# .dist-version    - The distributed package version. This file is NEVER
#                    checked in within the upstream repository, is auto-
#                    generated, and is only found in the package distribution.
#
# .local-version   - The current source code controlled package version. This
#                    file is NEVER checked in within the upstream repository,
#                    is auto-generated, and can always be found in both the
#                    build tree and distribution.
#

# .dist-version second, and the .default-version last.
