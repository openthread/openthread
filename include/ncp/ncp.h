/**
 * @brief Send data to the host via a specific stream.
 *
 * This function attempts to send the given data to the host
 * using the given aStreamId. This is useful for reporting
 * error messages, implementing debug/diagnostic consoles,
 * and potentially other types of datastreams.
 *
 * The write either is accepted in its entirety or rejected.
 * Partial writes are not attempted.
 *
 * @param[in]  aStreamId  A numeric identifier for the stream to write to.
 *                        If set to '0', will default to the debug stream.
 * @param[in]  aDataPtr   A pointer to the data to send on the stream.
 *                        If aDataLen is non-zero, this param MUST NOT be NULL.
 * @param[in]  aDataLen   The number of bytes of data from aDataPtr to send.
 *
 * @retval kThreadError_None  The data was queued for delivery to the host.
 * @retval kThreadError_Busy  There are not enough resources to complete this
 *                            request. This is usually a temporary condition.
 * @retval kThreadError_InvalidArgs The given aStreamId was invalid.
