 * The @p aService and all its contained information (strings and buffers) are only valid during this call. The
 * platform MUST save a copy of the information if it wants to retain the information after returning from this
 * function.
 *
 * The fields in @p aService follow these rules:
 *
 * - The `mServiceInstance` and `mServiceType` fields specify the service instance label and service type name,
 *   respectively. They are never NULL.
 * - The `mHostName` field specifies the host name of the service if it is not NULL. Otherwise, if it is NULL, it
 *   indicates that this service is for the device itself and leaves the host name selection to DNS-SD platform.
 * - The `mSubTypeLabels` is an array of strings representing sub-types associated with the service. It can be NULL
 *   if there are no sub-types. Otherwise, the array length is specified by `mSubTypeLabelsLength`.
 * - The `mTxtData` and `mTxtDataLength` fields specify the encoded TXT data.
 * - The `mPort`, `mWeight`, and `mPriority` fields specify the service's parameters (as specified in DNS SRV record).
 * - The `mTtl` field specifies the TTL if non-zero. If zero, the platform can choose the TTL to use.
 * - The `mInfraIfIndex` field, if non-zero, specifies the infrastructure network interface index to use for this
 *   request. If zero, the platform implementation can decided the interface.
 *
 * When the `mHostName` field in @p aService is not NULL (indicating that this registration is on behalf of another
 * host), the OpenThread stack will ensure that `otPlatDnssdRegisterHost()` is also called for the same host before any
 * service registration requests for the same host.
 *
 * Once the registration request is finished, either successfully or failed, the platform reports the outcome by
 * invoking the @p aCallback and passing the same @p aRequestId in the callback. The @p aCallback function pointer can
 * be NULL, which indicates that the OpenThread stack does not need to be notified of the outcome of the request.
 * If the outcome is determined, the platform implementation may invoke the @p aCallback before returning from this
 * function. The OpenThread stack will ensure to handle such a situation.
 *
 * On success, the @p aCallback MUST be called (if non-NULL) with `OT_ERROR_NONE` as the `aError` input parameter. If
 * the registration causes a name conflict on DNS-SD domain (the service instance name is already claimed by another
 * host), the `OT_ERROR_DUPLICATED` error MUST be used. The platform implementation can use other `OT_ERROR` types for
 * other types of errors.
 *
 * The platform implementation MUST not assume that the @p aRequestId used in subsequent requests will be different.
 * OpenThread may reuse the same request ID again for a different request.
 *
 * The OpenThread stack will not register the same service (with no changes) that was registered successfully earlier.
 * Therefore, the platform implementation does not need to check for duplicate/same service and can assume that calls
 * to this function are either registering a new entry or changing some parameter in a previously registered item. As
 * a result, these changes always need to be synced on the infrastructure DNS-SD module.
 *
 * The OpenThread stack does not require the platform implementation to always invoke the @p aCallback function.
 * The OpenThread stack has its own mechanism to time out an aged request with no response. This relaxes the
 * requirement for platform implementations.
