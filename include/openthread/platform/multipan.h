/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 *   This file defines the multipan interface for OpenThread.
 *
 *   Multipan RCP is a feature that allows single RCP operate in multiple networks.
 *
 *   Currently we support two types of multipan RCP:
 *   - Full multipan: RCP operates in parallel on both networks (for example using more than one transceiver)
 *   - Switching RCP: RCP can communicate only with one network at a time and requires network switching mechanism.
 *                    Switching can be automatic (for example time based, radio sleep based) or manually contolled by
 *                    the host.
 *
 *   Full multipan RCP and Automatic Switching RCP do not require any special care from the host side.
 *   Manual Switching RCP requires host to switch currently active network.
 *
