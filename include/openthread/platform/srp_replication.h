 * This function starts or stops DNS-SD browse to discover SRPL partners within the local domain.
 *
 * On start platform layer MUST initiate an ongoing DNS-SD browse on the service name "_srpl-tls._tcp" within the local
 * browsing domain to discover SRPL partners. The ongoing browse will produce two different types of events:
 * "add" events and "remove" events.  When the browse is started, it should produce an "add" event for every SRPL
 * partner currently present on the network.  Whenever a partner goes offline, a "remove" event should be produced.
 * remove"  events are not guaranteed, however.
 *
 * When an SRP partner is discovered, a new ongoing DNS-SD query for A/AAAA record MUST be started on the hostname
 * indicated in the SRV record of the discovered entry. If multiple host IPv6 addressees are discovered for a partner,
 * one with highest scope among all addresses MUST be reported (if there are multiple address at same scope, one must
 * be selected randomly).
 *
 * SRPL platform MUST signal back the discovered partner info using `otPlatSrplHandleDnssdBrowseResult()` callback.
 * This callback MUST be invoked when a new partner is added or removed. If there is a change to TXT record of an
 * already discovered/added service on an SRP partner, then platform MUST call `otPlatSrplHandleDnssdBrowseResult()`
 * with new TXT record info. If the IPv6 address of the an already discovered/added service changes, then the platform
 * MUST first call `otPlatSrplHandleDnssdBrowseResult()` to remove the old address, before calling it again to add
 * the new address.
 *
 * SRPL platform MUST NOT invoke `otPlatSrplHandleDnssdBrowseResult()` for the SRPL service instance that is registered
 * by the device itself. This may be realized by checking the service instance's IPv6 address against its own addresses.
 *
 * @param[in]  aInstance  The OpenThread instance.
 * @param[out] aEnable    TRUE to start DNS-SD browse, FALSE to stop it.
