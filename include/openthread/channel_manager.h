 * This function requests that `ChannelManager` checks and selects a new channel and starts a channel change.
 *
 * Unlike the `otChannelManagerRequestChannelChange()` where the channel must be given as a parameter, this function
 * asks the `ChannelManager` to select a channel by itself (based of collected channel quality info).
 *
 * Once called, the Channel Manager will perform the following 3 steps:
 *
 * 1) `ChannelManager` decides if the channel change would be helpful. This check can be skipped if
 *    `aSkipQualityCheck` is set to true (forcing a channel selection to happen and skipping the quality check).
 *    This step uses the collected link quality metrics on the device (such as CCA failure rate, frame and message
 *    error rates per neighbor, etc.) to determine if the current channel quality is at the level that justifies
 *    a channel change.
 *
 * 2) If the first step passes, then `ChannelManager` selects a potentially better channel. It uses the collected
 *    channel quality data by `ChannelMonitor` module. The supported and favored channels are used at this step.
 *    (@sa otChannelManagerSetSupportedChannels, @sa otChannelManagerSetFavoredChannels).
 *
 * 3) If the newly selected channel is different from the current channel, `ChannelManager` requests/starts the
 *    channel change process (internally invoking a `RequestChannelChange()`).
 *
 * @param[in] aInstance                A pointer to an OpenThread instance.
 * @param[in] aSkipQualityCheck        Indicates whether the quality check (step 1) should be skipped.

 * @retval OT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND          Supported channel mask is empty, therefore could not select a channel.
