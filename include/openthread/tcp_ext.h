/**
 * This structure represents a circular send buffer for use with a TCP endpoint.
 *
 * Using a circular send buffer is optional. Applications can use a TCP
 * endpoint to send data by managing otLinkedBuffers directly. However, some
 * applications may find it more convenient to have a circular send buffer;
 * such applications can call otTcpCircularSendBufferWrite() to "attach" a
 * circular send buffer to a TCP endpoint and send out data on that TCP
 * endpoint, relying on the circular send buffer to manage the underlying
 * otLinkedBuffers.
 *
 * otTcpCircularSendBuffer is implemented on top of the otLinkedBuffer-based
 * API provided by an otTcpEndpoint. Once attached to an otTcpEndpoint, an
 * otTcpCircularSendBuffer performs all the work of managing otLinkedBuffers
 * for the connection. This means that, once an otTcpCircularSendBuffer is
 * attached to an otTcpEndpoint, the application should not call
 * otTcpSendByReference() or otTcpSendByExtension() on that otTcpEndpoint.
 * Instead, the application should use otTcpCircularSendBufferWrite() to add
 * data to the send buffer.
 *
 * The otTcpForwardProgress() callback is the intended way for users to learn
 * when space becomes available in the circular send buffer. On an
 * otTcpEndpoint to which an otTcpCircularSendBuffer is attached, the
 * application MUST install an otTcpForwardProgress() callback and call
 * otTcpCircularSendBufferHandleForwardProgress() on the attached
 * otTcpCircularSendBuffer at the start of the callback function. It is
 * recommended that the user NOT install an otTcpSendDone() callback, as all
 * management of otLinkedBuffers is handled by the circular send buffer.
 *
 * The application should not inspect the fields of this structure directly; it
 * should only interact with it via the TCP Circular Send Buffer API functions
 * whose signature are provided in this file.

 * @p aEndpoint must be made using @p aSendBuffer and ALL operations on
 * @p aSendBuffer must be associated with @p aEndpoint .

 * wait for the send buffer to become completely empty. This can happen in two

 * course of TCP protocol operation, or (2) the connection is terminated.
 *
 * The recommended usage pattern is to use a single TCP circular send buffer
 * with a TCP endpoint, and to send data on that TCP endpoint only via its
 * associated TCP circular buffer. This recommended usage pattern sidesteps the
 * issues described above by always using a TCP endpoint and TCP circular send
 * buffer together.
