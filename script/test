ENVIRONMENTS:
    NODE_TYPE       'sim' for CLI, 'ncp-sim' for NCP. The default is 'sim'.
    NODE_MODE       'transceiver' for transceiver mode, otherwise for standalone mode. The default is standalone mode.
    VIRTUAL_TIME    1 for virtual time, otherwise real time. The default is 1

COMMANDS:
    clean           Clean built files to prepare for new build.
    build           Build project for running tests. This can be used to rebuild the project for changes.
    cert            Run a single thread-cert test. ENVIRONMENTS should be the same as those given to build or update.
    help            Print this help.
