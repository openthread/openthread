GitHub Issues are for bugs and feature requests.  To make bugs and feature requests more easy to find and organize, we close issues that are deemed out of scope for GitHub Issues.

Usage questions? Post questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) using the [[openthread] tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openthread). We also use Google Groups for discussion and announcements:

* [openthread-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openthread-announce) - subscribe for release notes and new updates on OpenThread
* [openthread-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openthread-users) - the best place for users to discuss OpenThread and interact with the OpenThread team
* [openthread-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openthread-devel) - team members discuss the on-going development of OpenThread
