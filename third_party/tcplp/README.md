## Description

TCPlp is a full-scale TCP stack for low-power wireless networks and
resource-constrained embedded systems. It is designed to support performant and
efficient TCP operation over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. It is based on the TCP
stack in the FreeBSD operating system.

TCPlp is a software artifact that accompanies an NSDI 2020 paper:

Sam Kumar, Michael P Andersen, Hyung-Sin Kim, and David E. Culler. Performant TCP for Low-Power Wireless Networks. NSDI 2020.
