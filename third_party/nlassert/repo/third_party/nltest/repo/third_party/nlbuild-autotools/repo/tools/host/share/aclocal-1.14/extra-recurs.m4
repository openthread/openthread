# AM_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_TARGETS
# --------------------------
# Define the list of user recursive targets.  This macro exists only to
# be traced by Automake, which will ensure that a proper definition of
# user-defined recursive targets (and associated rules) is propagated
# into all the generated Makefiles.
# TODO: We should really reject non-literal arguments here...
