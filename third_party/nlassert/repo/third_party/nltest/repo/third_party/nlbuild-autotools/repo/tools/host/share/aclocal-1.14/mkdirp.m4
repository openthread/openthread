dnl FIXME message accordingly.
AC_DIAGNOSE([obsolete],
[$0: this macro is deprecated, and will soon be removed.
You should use the Autoconf-provided 'AC][_PROG_MKDIR_P' macro instead,
and use '$(MKDIR_P)' instead of '$(mkdir_p)'in your Makefile.am files.])
dnl Automake 1.8 to 1.9.6 used to define mkdir_p.  We now use MKDIR_P,
dnl while keeping a definition of mkdir_p for backward compatibility.
dnl @MKDIR_P@ is magic: AC_OUTPUT adjusts its value for each Makefile.
dnl However we cannot define mkdir_p as $(MKDIR_P) for the sake of
dnl Makefile.ins that do not define MKDIR_P, so we do our own
dnl adjustment using top_builddir (which is defined more often than
dnl MKDIR_P).
