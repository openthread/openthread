/**
 *    @file
 *      This file provides an ISO/IEC 9899:1999-, C89-, and
 *      C99-compatible Standard C Library header and assertion
 *      interface definition, implemented atop of Nest Labs assertion
 *      checking and runtime exception interfaces such that consistent
 *      platform and system capabilities, behavior, and output may
 *      be implemented and enforced across the two interfaces.
 *
 *      Systems wishing to use this in lieu of their Standard C
 *      Library header of the same name should ensure that their
 *      toolchain is configured to either ignore or deprioritize
 *      standard search paths while placing the directory this header
 *      is contained in among the preferred header search paths.

/**
 *  @def assert(aExpression)
 *
 *  @brief
 *    This checks for the specified condition, which is expected to
 *    commonly be true and takes action, based on configuration, and
 *    aborts the current program execution if the condition is false.
 *
 *  This provides a workalike macro for the ISO/IEC 9899:1999, C89,
 *  and C99 Standard C Library
 *  [assert()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/assert.html)
 *  macro interface and bases it upon the equivalent #nlASSERT macro,
 *  which has the same behavior and semantics.
 *
 *  System integrators may want to use this as opposed to their native
 *  Standard C Library assert() to ensure consistent capabilities,
 *  behavior, and output across their software modules when runtime
 *  assertions occur where the Nest Labs assertion checking and
 *  runtime exception handling is also used.
 *
 *  @param[in]  aExpression  A Boolean expression to be evaluated.
