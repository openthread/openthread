 * format when dealing with both 16-bit and 128-bit UUIDs without having to check for lengths and having split code
 * paths. This is accomplished by extending the grouping mechanism that the Bluetooth SIG standard base UUID uses
 * for all other 128-bit UUIDs. The type field in the @ref ble_uuid_t structure is an index (relative to
 * @ref BLE_UUID_TYPE_VENDOR_BEGIN) to the table populated by multiple calls to this function, and the UUID field
 * in the same structure contains the 2 bytes at indexes 12 and 13. The number of possible 128-bit UUIDs available to
 * the application is therefore the number of Vendor Specific UUIDs added with the help of this function times 65536,
 * although restricted to modifying bytes 12 and 13 for each of the entries in the supplied array.
 *
 * @note Bytes 12 and 13 of the provided UUID will not be used internally, since those are always replaced by
 * the 16-bit uuid field in @ref ble_uuid_t.
