# Changelog
All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added wait-for function to improve time-out functionality in QSPI and SAADC drivers.
- Added glue layer for interrupt pending set/clear and is set functions.
- Added new interrupts and events to UARTE HAL.

### Changed
- Extended input pin configuration in GPIOTE driver.
- Unified the way of checking if required event handler was provided. Now, all drivers do it with assertion.
- Improved condition checking in uninit and init functions in SAADC driver.
- Enabled RNG bias correction by default.
- Updated MDK to 8.15.4.
- Refactored ADC driver and HAL.
- Corrected TIMER asserts to make it usable with PPI in debug.
- Improved buffer handling in I2S driver. The API of the driver has been sligthly modified.

### Fixed
- Fixed result value casting in TEMP HAL.
- Fixed types of conversion result and buffer size in ADC HAL and driver.
- Fixed timeout in SAADC driver in abort function.

## [0.8.0] - 2017-12-20
### Added
- Added XIP support in the QSPI driver.
- Implemented Errata 132 in the CLOCK driver.
- Added function for checking if a TIMER instance is enabled.
- Added extended SPIM support.

### Changed
- Updated MDK to 8.15.0. Introduced Segger Embedded Studio startup files.
- Updated drivers: COMP, PWM, QDEC, SAADC, SPIS, TIMER, TWI, TWIS.
- Changed the type used for transfer lengths to 'size_t' in drivers: SPI, SPIM, SPIS, TWI, TWIM, TWIS, UART, UARTE. Introduced checking of EasyDMA transfers limits.
- Updated HALs: COMP, NVMC, UART, UARTE, USBD.
- Updated template files and documentation of configuration options.

### Fixed
- Fixed TWI and TWIM drivers so that they now support GPIOs from all ports.
- Fixed definitions related to compare channels in the TIMER HAL.

### Removed
- Removed the possibility of passing NULL instead of configuration to get default settings during drivers initialization.
- Removed support for UART1 and PRS box #5.

## [0.7.0] - 2017-10-20
