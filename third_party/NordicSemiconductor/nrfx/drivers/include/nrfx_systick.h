 * @brief   ARM(R) SysTick driver.
 *
 * This driver configures ARM(R) SysTick as a free-running timer.
 * This timer is used to generate delays and pool for timeouts.
 * Only relatively short timeouts are supported.
 * The SysTick works on 64MHz and is 24-bits wide.
 * It means that it overflows around 4 times per second and around 250&nbsp;ms
 * would be the highest supported time in the library.
 * But it would be really hard to detect if overflow was generated without
 * using interrupts. For safety we would limit the maximum delay range by half.
