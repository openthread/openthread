 *                        the previous time the data handler signaled such need.
 *                        This means that data corruption occurred (the previous
 *                        buffers are used for the second time) and no buffers
 *                        can be released at the moment.
 *                        Both pointers in this structure are NULL when the
 *                        handler is called for the first time after a transfer
 *                        is started, because no data has been transferred yet
 *                        at this point. In all successive calls the pointers
 *                        specify what has been sent (TX) and what has been
 *                        received (RX) in the part of transfer that has just
