/**
 * @brief Function for preparing a TWI transfer.
 *
 * The following transfer types can be configured (@ref nrfx_twim_xfer_desc_t::type):
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TXRX<span></span>: Write operation followed by a read operation (without STOP condition in between).
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TXTX<span></span>: Write operation followed by a write operation (without STOP condition in between).
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TX<span></span>:   Write operation (with or without STOP condition).
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_RX<span></span>:   Read operation  (with STOP condition).
 *
 * @note TXRX and TXTX transfers are supported only in non-blocking mode.
 *
 * Additional options are provided using the flags parameter:
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_TX_POSTINC and @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_RX_POSTINC<span></span>: Post-incrementation of buffer addresses. Supported only by TWIM.
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_NO_XFER_EVT_HANDLER<span></span>: No user event handler after transfer completion. In most cases, this also means no interrupt at the end of the transfer.
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_HOLD_XFER<span></span>: Driver is not starting the transfer. Use this flag if the transfer is triggered externally by PPI. Supported only by TWIM.
 *   Use @ref nrfx_twim_start_task_get to get the address of the start task.
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER<span></span>: Prepare for repeated transfers. You can set up a number of transfers that will be triggered externally (for example by PPI).
 *   An example is a TXRX transfer with the options @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_RX_POSTINC, @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_NO_XFER_EVT_HANDLER, and @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER.
 *   After the transfer is set up, a set of transfers can be triggered by PPI that will read, for example, the same register of an
 *   external component and put it into a RAM buffer without any interrupts. @ref nrfx_twim_stopped_event_get can be used to get the
 *   address of the STOPPED event, which can be used to count the number of transfers. If @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER is used,
 *   the driver does not set the driver instance into busy state, so you must ensure that the next transfers are set up
 *   when TWIM is not active. Supported only by TWIM.
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_TX_NO_STOP<span></span>: No stop condition after TX transfer.
 *
 * @note
 * Some flag combinations are invalid:
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_TX_NO_STOP with @ref nrfx_twim_xfer_desc_t::type different than @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TX
 * - @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER with @ref nrfx_twim_xfer_desc_t::type set to @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TXTX
 *
 * If @ref nrfx_twim_xfer_desc_t::type is set to @ref NRFX_TWIM_XFER_TX and the @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_TX_NO_STOP and @ref NRFX_TWIM_FLAG_REPEATED_XFER
 * flags are set, two tasks must be used to trigger a transfer: TASKS_RESUME followed by TASKS_STARTTX. If no stop condition is generated,
 * TWIM is in SUSPENDED state. Therefore, it must be resumed before the transfer can be started.
 *
 * @note Peripherals using EasyDMA (including TWIM) require the transfer buffers
 *       to be placed in the Data RAM region. If this condition is not met,
 *       this function will fail with the error code NRFX_ERROR_INVALID_ADDR.
