/* In order to make use this file,
        1. For Keil uVision IDE, in the Options for Target -> Asm tab, define symbol __STARTUP_CONFIG and use the additional assembler option --cpreproc in Misc Control text box.
        2. For GCC compiling, add extra assembly option -D__STARTUP_CONFIG.
        3. For IAR Embedded Workbench define symbol __STARTUP_CONFIG in the Assembler options and define symbol __STARTUP_CONFIG=1 in the linker options.
