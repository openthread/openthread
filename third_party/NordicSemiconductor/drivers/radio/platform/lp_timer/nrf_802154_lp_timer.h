 * @brief Low Power Timer Abstraction Layer interface for the 802.15.4 driver.
 *
 * Low Power Timer Abstraction Layer is an abstraction layer of timer that is meant to be used by
 * the nRF 802.15.4 driver. This timer should provide low latency (max 100 us) in order to allow
 * implementation in the driver code features like:
 * * Timing out waiting for ACK frame
 * * SIFS and LIFS
 * * CSMA/CA
 * * CSL
 * * Auto polling by rx-off-when-idle devices
 *
 * @note Most of Low Power Timer Abstraction Layer API should not be called directly by 802.15.4 driver
 *       modules. This API is used by the Timer Scheduler module included in the driver and other
 *       modules should use Timer Scheduler API. Exception from above rule are initialization and
 *       deinitialization functions @sa nrf_802154_lp_timer_init()
 *       @sa nrf_802154_lp_timer_deinit() and critical section management
 *       @sa nrf_802154_lp_timer_critical_section_enter()
 *       @sa nrf_802154_lp_timer_critical_section_exit() as these functions are called from
 *       nrf_802154_critical_section module and from global initialization functions
 *       @sa nrf_802154_init() @sa nrf_802154_deinit().
