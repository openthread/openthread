 * @note  If the USB is also used for other purposes, then this function must be called after USB is

 *        NRF_DFU_TRIGGER_USB_USB_SHARED must be set to 1.
 *
 * @note  Calling this again after the first success has no effect and returns @ref NRF_SUCCESS.
 *
 * @note  If @ref APP_USBD_CONFIG_EVENT_QUEUE_ENABLE is on (1), USB events must be handled manually.
 *        See @ref app_usbd_event_queue_process.
 *
 * @retval NRF_SUCCESS  On successful initialization.
 * @return An error code on failure, for example if called at a wrong time.
