/**
 * @defgroup nrf_atfifo Atomic FIFO
 * @ingroup app_common
 *
 * @brief @tagAPI52 FIFO implementation that allows for making atomic transactions without
 * locking interrupts.
 *
 * @details There are two types of functions to prepare the FIFO writing:
 * - Single function for simple access:
 * @code
 * if (NRF_SUCCESS != nrf_atfifo_simple_put(my_fifo, &data, NULL))
 * {
 *      // Error handling
 * }
 * @endcode
 * - Function pair to limit data copying:
 * @code
 * struct point3d
 * {
 *      int x, y, z;
 * }point3d_t;
 * nrf_atfifo_context_t context;
 * point3d_t * point;
 *
 * if (NULL != (point = nrf_atfifo_item_alloc(my_fifo, &context)))
 * {
 *      point->x = a;
 *      point->y = b;
 *      point->z = c;
 *      if (nrf_atfifo_item_put(my_fifo, &context))
 *      {
 *          // Send information to the rest of the system
 *          // that there is new data in the FIFO available for reading.
 *      }
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *      // Error handling
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 * @note
 * This atomic FIFO implementation requires that the operation that is
 * opened last is finished (committed/flushed) first.
 * This is typical for operations performed from the interrupt runtime
 * when the other operation is performed from the main thread.
 *
 * This implementation does not support typical multithreading operating system
 * access where operations can be started and finished in totally unrelated order.
