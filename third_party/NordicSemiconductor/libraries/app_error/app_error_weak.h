/**@brief       Callback function for errors, asserts, and faults.
 *
 * @details     This function is called every time an error is raised in app_error, nrf_assert, or
 *              in the SoftDevice. Information about the error can be found in the @p info
 *              parameter.
 *
 *              See also @ref nrf_fault_handler_t for more details.
 *
 * @note        The function is implemented as weak so that it can be redefined by a custom error
 *              handler when needed.
 *
 * @param[in] id    Fault identifier. See @ref NRF_FAULT_IDS.
 * @param[in] pc    The program counter of the instruction that triggered the fault, or 0 if
 *                  unavailable.
 * @param[in] info  Optional additional information regarding the fault. The value of the @p id
 *                  parameter dictates how to interpret this parameter. Refer to the documentation
 *                  for each fault identifier (@ref NRF_FAULT_IDS and @ref APP_ERROR_FAULT_IDS) for
 *                  details about interpreting @p info.
