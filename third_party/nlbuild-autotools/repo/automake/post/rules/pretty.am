#    Description:
#      This file is the automake footer for code style checking and
#      reformatting related targets and rules.
#

pretty: pretty-recursive

#
# 'pretty' target calls astyle on each file in SOURCES and HEADERS.
# This iteratively calls astyle on each file.  astyle seems to retain
# state from processing a previous file, which sometimes causes
# formatting of a subsequent file to fail.
