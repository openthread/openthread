#    Description:
#      This file is the automake footer for all code-coverage related
#      targets and rules.
#
#      This represents the minimum integration with GNU autotools
#      (automake inparticular) such that 'make coverage' may be invoked
#      at the top of the tree and all the prerequisites occur such
#      that it executes successfully with no intervening make target
#      invocations. The 'check-am' and '$(BUILT_SOURCES)' are the key
#      automake-specific dependencies to ensure that happens.
