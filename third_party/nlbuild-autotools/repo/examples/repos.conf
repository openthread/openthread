# You can synchronize a remote package on which yours depends with git
# to 'third_party' (or another directory).
#
# Here is an example using nlunit-test. Uncomment and adapter or
# delete this, as needed. If you do not have any packages to
# sychronize, then this file is unneeded and may be deleted from your
# project.
#
# If you choose to use this, please also take a look at configure.ac,
# Makefile.am, and third_party/Makefile.am and uncomment the appropriate
# sections there.

# [submodule "nlunit-test"]
# 	path = third_party/nlunit-test/repo
# 	url = https://github.com/nestlabs/nlunit-test.git
# 	branch = master
# 	update = none
