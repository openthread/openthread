## Description

mbed TLS (formerly known as PolarSSL) makes it trivially easy for
developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their
(embedded) products, facilitating this functionality with a minimal
coding footprint.

## Modifications

The patches in `third_party/mbedtls/patch` were applied to the
original mbed TLS source.  The patched source in
`third_party/mbedtls/repo.patched` was generated by executing
`third_party/mbedtls/patch.sh`.
