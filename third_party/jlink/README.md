## Description

With RTT it is possible to output information from the target microcontroller as
well as sending input to the application at a very high speed without affecting
the target's real time behavior. SEGGER RTT can be used with any J-Link model and
any supported target processor which allows background memory access, which are
Cortex-M and RX targets.
