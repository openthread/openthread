 * @brief Access QSPI flash when running in auto mode
 *
 * The QSPI controller allows to execute code directly from QSPI flash.
 * When code is executing from flash, it is not possible to reprogram the flash.
 * To be able to modify the flash when it is used for code execution, it must me assured that
 * for the time needed to erase/write, no code is running from flash.
 * To achieve this, the code in this module is executed from the RAM.
 * Code in this module will not access any other functions or constant variables that could reside
 * in flash.
