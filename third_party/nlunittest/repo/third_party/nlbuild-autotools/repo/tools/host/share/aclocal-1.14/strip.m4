# AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP
# ---------------------
# One issue with vendor 'install' (even GNU) is that you can't
# specify the program used to strip binaries.  This is especially
# annoying in cross-compiling environments, where the build's strip
# is unlikely to handle the host's binaries.
# Fortunately install-sh will honor a STRIPPROG variable, so we
# always use install-sh in "make install-strip", and initialize
# STRIPPROG with the value of the STRIP variable (set by the user).
AC_DEFUN([AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP],
[AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_SH])dnl
# Installed binaries are usually stripped using 'strip' when the user
# run "make install-strip".  However 'strip' might not be the right
# tool to use in cross-compilation environments, therefore Automake
# will honor the 'STRIP' environment variable to overrule this program.
dnl Don't test for $cross_compiling = yes, because it might be 'maybe'.
