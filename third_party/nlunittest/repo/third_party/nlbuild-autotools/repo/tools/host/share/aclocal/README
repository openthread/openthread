This directory is where .m4 files providing third-party autoconf
macros can be placed to be automatically found by the aclocal(1)
program.

The .m4 files placed here could be shared among different versions
of aclocal, so be careful.

Even if no actual .m4 files are present, this directory is required
in order for aclocal to work properly.  Please do not remove it.
